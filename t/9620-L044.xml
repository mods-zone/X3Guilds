 <t id="15000">Infinity Oasis, once a thriving hub in the heart of Boron territory, found itself in the throes of destruction amid the tumultuous Boron Campaign. The relentless advance of the Split forces saw the sector fall into their control, repurposed as a strategic bastion for their war endeavors. In the aftermath of these seismic events, the fate of Infinity Oasis took a fortuitous turn as it became the custodial responsibility of the Celestial Navigators Guild.\n\nWith an unwavering commitment to reclaiming the splendor of this celestial haven, the Celestial Navigators Guild seized the opportunity to establish its headquarters within the beleaguered world.

 <t id="15001">Aphrodite's Storm unfolds as a cosmic vastness, earning its name from the tempestuous energy storms that gracefully traverse its celestial tapestry, a tribute to the formidable forces at play in the cosmos. Adorned with enchanting nebulae casting radiant hues of deep orange across the heavens, this sector's energy storms, the very namesake, orchestrate a symphony of vibrant lights, transforming navigation within the sector into an exhilarating and demanding odyssey.\n\nNotwithstanding the intricate navigational dance required, Aphrodite's Storm unveils a sector brimming with economic promise.

This celestial marvel has captured the attention of Industritech, prompting the establishment of their cutting-edge industrial venture upon this celestial canvas. The expansive and initially uninhabited planet, initially hailed as a potential paradise, has unfolded to reveal an unexpected reality — a realm teeming with some of the most perilous indigenous species ever encountered.\n\nWhat was once deemed an untouched paradise has transformed into a dynamic and challenging frontier, presenting a paradoxical juxtaposition of beauty and danger. Industritech, drawn by the allure of unexplored riches and the potential for groundbreaking discoveries, now faces the formidable task of navigating the intricate balance between progress and preservation in this newfound cosmic domain.\n\nThe burnt-orange sun, once a beacon of warmth and discovery, now casts its glow over a frontier where every step forward is an exploration into the unknown. The clash between industry and the untamed wilderness paints a vivid portrait of the delicate equilibrium that must be maintained in the pursuit of cosmic progress.</t>

 <t id="15005">The very moniker bestowed upon this sector, the Circle of Deceit, resonates with an ominous reputation, earned through its standing as an unbridled haven and burgeoning hub for cunning pirate factions. Here, clandestine operations and deceitful dealings unfurl a dark tapestry that extends far beyond the conventional boundaries of morality.\n\nThe Circle of Deceit emerges as a notorious stronghold, a gathering point for pirate factions drawn together by their shared proclivity for lawlessness and subterfuge. In the vast expanse of space, shrouded in shadows and hidden from the gaze of lawful authorities, this sector becomes their clandestine sanctuary—a meeting ground where nefarious schemes are hatched, and ruthless activities are meticulously orchestrated beyond the prying eyes of vigilant law enforcement.\n\nNestled within the cosmic abyss, the Circle of Deceit harbors the whispered conversations of pirates as they strategize and plan their illicit operations. The darkened reaches of this sector provide an ideal backdrop for these conspiratorial rendezvous, allowing pirates to operate with a veil of secrecy that shields them from the watchful eyes of authorities keen on suppressing their malevolent endeavors.</t>
 <t id="15006">This sector stands as a stark contrast to its optimistic name, embodying a realm where hope is eclipsed by the relentless onslaught of piracy, lawlessness, and the ruthless ambitions of those who call it home.\n\nFor smugglers seeking refuge from prying eyes, Hope's Nemesis is a paradise. Concealed among the asteroid fields and darkened celestial bodies, illicit activities thrive in the shadows. The sector's secluded nature makes it an ideal hub for smuggling operations, attracting those who thrive in the clandestine world of contraband and forbidden trade.</t>
 <t id="15007">In the annals of notorious pirates, Ashley Jovi stands as a legendary figure, celebrated for her audacious escape from the clutches of the enigmatic three-eyed captors. Seeking refuge, she found solace in a clandestine haven that would rewrite the narrative of pirate dominance. Cloaked within the ethereal embrace of a sprawling violet mist, emanating from the expansive nebula enshrouding the sector, Ashley deftly maneuvered through the cosmic veil, eluding vigilant Paranid patrols that sought to thwart her every move.\n\nHer strategic prowess and ability to navigate the treacherous terrain concealed within the nebular haze allowed Ashley to establish an impregnable stronghold. This refuge, over time, evolved into the most formidable territory within the vast domain of pirate clans. The hidden sanctuary not only became a bastion for those seeking refuge from lawful pursuits but also a thriving hub for piracy, a haven where the lawless could unite under Ashley's banner.</t>
 <t id="15008">This sector, shrouded in perpetual darkness and haunted by the whispers of celestial demise, serves as a grim testament to the relentless dominion of piracy and the shadows that conceal the nefarious activities within.\n\nEnveloped in an impenetrable shroud of darkness, Aphotic Necrosis is perpetually cast into shadows, concealing the illicit activities of its pirate denizens. The inky blackness provides an ideal cloak for covert operations, clandestine meetings, and nefarious dealings that transpire beyond the reach of watchful eyes.</t>
 <t id="15009">Within the vast expanse of the cosmic tapestry, Anacreon's Kingdom unfolds as a celestial realm veiled in the mystique and magnetic allure of the Yaki. This enigmatic faction, operating on the fringes of conventional space, has woven its identity into the very fabric of this sector. Anacreon's Kingdom stands as a testament to the Yaki's profound inclination towards cosmic anarchy, embodying a space where traditional norms of centralized governance and authoritative structures are conspicuously absent.</t>
 <t id="15010">Nestled on the fringes of the galaxy, the Antediluvian Ruins within the Yaki territory evoke an aura of mystery and ancient intrigue. This sector, veiled in the shadows of forgotten epochs, boasts the remnants of an ancient civilization long lost to time. Dilapidated structures and celestial artifacts from a bygone era are scattered across the vastness of space, telling tales of a once-thriving culture.</t>
 <t id="15011">Nestled in the celestial tapestry of Yaki-controlled space, the Kuiperian Descent unfolds as a region of cosmic allure and strategic importance. As the mysterious borderlands of Yaki territory, this sector encompasses a breathtaking expanse filled with vast asteroid fields, ice-covered celestial bodies, and the remnants of ancient comet trails.</t>
 <t id="15012">The Yaki's newly established homeworld presents itself as an inhospitable realm, deterring all other races from venturing into its depths. Enveloped in deep red clouds, the entire sector is characterized by intense heat that permeates the surroundings, rendering it less than comfortable. Exploiting the avoidance of this sector by other races to their advantage, the Yaki have successfully built up their own homeworld, transforming it into both their seat of power and a hub for illegal activities.</t>
 <t id="15013">The Beryll homeworld, a recently unveiled secret guarded closely, has attracted the attention of numerous races attempting to locate the elusive sector. Concealed behind an unconventional wormhole, it possesses ideal security measures to shield their pirate activities from inquisitive gazes. Despite the sector's discovery by other races, it persists in maintaining a relatively secure position deep within Yaki Space.</t>
 <t id="15014">Distinguished by the azure nebula cloud that gracefully adorns its expanse, Blue Horizon received a generous endowment from the Teladi to the Merchants Guild. Recognizing the guild's insatiable thirst for trade, a quality that resonates with the Teladi, they bestowed the sector as a strategic location. This gift enables the Guild to establish a presence nearby, strategically leveraging the trading expertise of the Guild for mutual benefit.</t>
 <t id="15015">After the Mercenaries guild made the strategic decision to relocate from Split space, they embarked on a journey that led them to the discovery of a vast, mostly untouched planet intricately connected to Paranid space. This uncharted world, teeming with unexplored potential, became the chosen site for their new headquarters, aptly named Mercenaries Vengeance.\n\nIn the wake of their resettlement, Mercenaries Vengeance has evolved into more than just a base of operations—it stands as the epicenter of their influence, radiating power across the expanse of the entire galaxy. The guild, once dispersed, now finds unity and strength within the walls of Mercenaries Vengeance. From this commanding vantage point, they deftly navigate the intricate web of interstellar politics, asserting their dominance and shaping the course of events that unfold in the cosmic theater. The gravitational pull of their influence extends far beyond the confines of their newfound sanctuary, touching the farthest reaches of the galaxy with the force of their strategic acumen and military prowess. Mercenaries Vengeance, once an unknown frontier, has transformed into a beacon of authority, symbolizing the guild's ascendancy and formidable presence in the ever-expanding cosmos.</t>
 <t id="15016">Nestled among the first Terran colonies, Terra Nova emerged as a testament to the early aspirations of the Terran people, offering a verdant haven reminiscent of their ancestral home, Earth. This lush green world, with its sprawling landscapes and familiar ecosystems, served as a poignant reminder of the natural beauty that the Terrans had longed to preserve beyond their homeworld.\n\nTragically, the idyllic existence of Terra Nova was abruptly interrupted by the relentless onslaught of the Xenon Invasions, leading to the loss of the colony. The once-thriving settlement fell into obscurity, its existence fading into the annals of history as the Terrans faced the challenges posed by the relentless Xenon threat.</t>
 <t id="15017">Dwelling in secrecy, this concealed realm, tethered to the known galaxy solely through an unpredictable wormhole, serves as the haven for a resolute Beryll faction. Within this hidden expanse, the faction harbors a unique perspective, perceiving the Xenon not as a mere robotic threat but as a sentient lifeform. In their unconventional belief system, they actively contribute to the Xenon's growth, a choice they view as beneficial, albeit to the detriment of the wider galaxy.</t>
 <t id="15018">Bestowed with a moniker paying homage to the colossal celestial entity that commands the entirety of the system, the Terrans ingeniously tapped into its potent energy reservoir. This strategic utilization of the celestial body's power emerged as a pivotal endeavor, serving as a sustainable energy source for the newly established colony worlds under the Terran banner. The radiant influence of this celestial powerhouse not only illuminated the cosmic expanse but also fueled the ambitions of the Terran pioneers as they ventured into the uncharted territories of space, laying the groundwork for thriving and self-sufficient colonies. The resonance of this celestial synergy echoed through the corridors of Terran innovation, exemplifying their commitment to harnessing the cosmic energies for the betterment and advancement of their burgeoning interstellar settlements.</t>
 <t id="15019">Nestled within Paradise Lost is a vast, ancient planet, now devoid of life. Once, this celestial body may have harbored existence, but an ominous, unidentified catastrophe has since reduced it to a desolate husk at the center of the sector.</t>
 <t id="15020">A testament to Terran technological triumph, Aurora Prime showcases the achievement of transforming a once-unremarkable world through meticulous terraforming into a relative paradise.</t>
 <t id="15021">Amidst the vast cosmic expanse, the Zentati of Corruption stands as a foreboding testament to the darker undercurrents of the pirate's way of life. This sector, shrouded in an aura of nefarious intent, has earned its notorious reputation as a haven for piracy and illicit dealings.\n\nThe celestial panorama unfolds with sinister beauty, marked by turbulent asteroid fields and the ominous glow of corrupted nebulae that paint the stars with an otherworldly malevolence. The sector's history is etched in the decayed remnants of once-thriving stations, now repurposed as clandestine bases for the pirates who have embraced the allure of corruption.</t>
 <t id="15022">In the clandestine corridors of Narayan's Revenge, a subversive allure beckons both aspiring pirates and fortune seekers alike, drawing them into the very heart of lawlessness. The promise of untold riches, concealed within the tumultuous chaos of this infamous sector, becomes an irresistible call that echoes through the cosmic void. Yet, as they cautiously navigate the treacherous waters of this pirate haven, these daring individuals quickly come to realize that the pursuit of wealth within Narayan's Revenge is akin to dancing on the razor's edge.</t>
 <t id="15023">Nestled within the hidden recesses of the galactic underworld, Storm Shadows stands as a notorious domain, its very name whispered in the clandestine circles of the Thieves Guild.\n\nWithin the shadowy enclaves of Storm Shadows, the Thieves Guild thrives, engaging in a myriad of illicit activities — from discreet transactions and covert negotiations to the planning of audacious heists. The sector's atmosphere is charged with an air of intrigue and risk, where every shadow holds the potential for both fortune and peril.</t>
 <t id="15024">Established by a collective of Boron scientists, this colony was strategically founded on a vast water-based planet, deemed ideal for a new Boron settlement. However, over time, the planet succumbed to an ice age, encasing the once-glorious waters in frozen stillness. The Boron military, once the stalwart guardians of this world, were redeployed during the height of the Boron Campaign, leaving the vulnerable scientists defenseless.\n\nIn the absence of Boron protection, a coalition of pirate clans seized the opportunity and ousted the remaining Boron inhabitants, establishing the planet as a haven for piracy. Since then, it has stood as a notorious bastion of lawlessness, perpetuating a legacy of piracy that endures through the frozen expanse.</t>
 <t id="15025">The sector is unequivocally ruled by the radiant presence of twin suns, their luminous brilliance casting a breathtaking glow across the expansive canvas of the celestial stage. These two celestial giants stand as beacons in the cosmic ballet, their rays painting mesmerizing patterns of light and shadow upon the vast expanse of the oceanic world that sprawls beneath. The interplay of sunlight on the undulating waves of the planetary ocean creates a spectacle of sparkling reflections and dancing hues, transforming the entire panorama into a living, dynamic masterpiece. As pilots traverse this captivating sector, they are greeted by the ethereal spectacle of the twin suns' glimmering radiance, an awe-inspiring testament to the beauty woven into the cosmic fabric of this remarkable celestial domain.</t>
 <t id="15026">{19,15020}</t>
 <t id="15027">{19,1031006}</t>
 <t id="15028">The newly identified Xenon Sector emerges as a focal point for extensive Xenon activity. Despite its previous isolation from the broader galaxy, the sector has now been reintegrated, evolving into a strategic staging ground for an imminent Xenon invasion. This development marks the initiation of the latest Xenon Wars, with the sector serving as a crucial nexus in the unfolding conflict.</t>
 <t id="15029">{19,15028}</t>
 <t id="15030">Tucked away in the galactic periphery, Smuggler's Paradise emerges as a discreet haven for those entwined in the clandestine dance of illicit commerce and covert dealings. A stellar landscape unfolds, adorned with nebulous clouds and meandering asteroid belts, providing a natural shroud for the activities of the audacious individuals who call this sector home.</t>
 <t id="15031">An independent system located on the outskirts of Teladi space, Privateer Gate is host to the planet of the same name, and is populated by a wide selection of races from across the galaxy who have \(for whatever reason\) become disillusioned with life in the Commonwealth and have seen fit to try and &quot;go it alone&quot; without their assistance. \n\nWhile the path of many systems that follow this route often ends in anarchy, the population of Privateer Gate are notable for having made a very good show of things, boasting a strong planetary-based economy, a relatively high GDP rating, and comparatively low rates of crime and illness.\n\nThere is an underlying question of just how the people of Privateer Gate have managed to become so prosperous, however, for the space between the main gates of this sector is unusually safe and free of the usual detritus that independent systems seem to attract. \n\nThere are many who speculate that Privateer Gate may be under the protection of a mysterious benefactor...</t>
 <t id="15032">Within the boundaries of the Privateer Independence Alliance, this sector poses a hazard, situated at the border of two antagonistic factions. Flanked by Xenon on one side and pirates on the other, the sector has the potential to transform into a substantial battleground.</t>
 <t id="15033">Initially believed to harbor the sought-after Earth-related secrets by the Goner faction, this sector witnessed the forced departure of the priests due to incessant pirate assaults, succeeded by Kha'ak invasions. In time, the sector aligned itself with the Privateer Independence Alliance, joining forces with its neighboring systems.</t>
 <t id="15034">Nestled on the periphery of the Zeta Rho nebula within Privateer territory, Farpoint Omega resides at the heart of the affectionately termed Privateer Corridor. Notably, it stands out as one of the rare sectors hosting an independent shipyard, catering to anyone with the necessary credits.</t>
 <t id="15035">Believed to exist somewhere within an area of the universe that is - or was - part of Kha'ak Space, &quot;Zeta Rho&quot; is an ominous yet mysteriously beautiful Sector of Commonwealth space that few explorers dare travel. \n\nWhile its main feature is the dense violet photoluminescence from the dust particles and stellar gases that dominate the region, Zeta Rho is also notable for the thick density of asteroids that have apparently been caught and clustered together over thousands of millennia.\n\nAlthough these asteroids could potentially be exploited by an intrepid privateer or corporation and turned into a lucrative base of power, there are few within Commonwealth Space who even know this sector exists - and even fewer who are willing to risk their assets with the threat of the Kha'ak looming in every shadow. \n\nDauntless pioneers are advised to take care in this sector due to the poor levels of visibility caused by the nebula, and the large number of navigational hazards equally present in the area.</t>
 <t id="15036">Dubbed after the imminent supernova, Mgrophiya teeters on the brink of habitability, featuring two sizable lifeless planets. Consequently, numerous factions declined the chance to govern the sector, opting for independence before eventually aligning with the Privateer Independence Alliance. It stood as one of the inaugural sectors forming the renowned Privateer Corridor.</t>
 <t id="15037">Solitas is an unusual and somewhat foreboding sector with an equally dramatic history. It is said that the Royal Boron Navy engaged and ultimately destroyed a large Xenon vessel of an unknown design as it was attempting to build a relay station within the debris field of the sundered planet for which the sector is named.\n\nThe Boron suffered heavy losses, but succeeded in preventing the sector from falling to the Xenon.\n\nWhile many vessels and fallen Boron were recovered and repatriated in the wake of the conflict, a few vessels have been left behind as a silent memorial to the battle that took place here.</t>
 <t id="15038">Experiencing multiple shifts in control during its brief existence, this sector was initially discovered and colonized by the Paranid. However, nearby Pirate sectors later asserted ownership of the area. Numerous fiercely contested battles unfolded between the Pirates and Paranid for dominance. Ultimately, other factions intervened, proclaiming the sector's independence, and it has since become a part of the Privateer Independence Alliance.</t>
 <t id="15039">After securing their base of power within Weaver's Tempest, the Yaki allocated some of its resources towards securing a new sector isolated from the rest of the galaxy from which they could continue to fortify their infrastructure and develop their fleet further without harassment.\n\nFar removed from the trade-lanes and military patrols of the Commonwealth, the Yaki Sector of Redemption is the result of that goal, and has been quickly developed into a second fortified system from which the Yaki can plan further reprisals against their foes.\n\nContrary to popular conceptions about the Yaki dynamic, the main planet of Fortuna is a bastion of law and order. Their strict policy of governance values honor and dignity and community spirit above all else, and any crime that erodes these ideals - no matter how minor - is punishable by death.\n\nIt could be said that Fortuna - if not the entire sector itself - harbours more stability and security than even some of the most affluent Commonwealth systems do, with those living under Yaki rule experiencing both security and the benefits of high-technology regardless of their wealth or status.</t>
 <t id="15040">{19,1030421}</t>
 <t id="15041">There is little recorded history of who once called this sector home, nor any memory of the people or race that inhabited this independent sector. \n\nWhat is known, however, is that those who once lived here stood little chance against the Xenon who invaded; the silent relics of their stations are now the only testament to their existence and subsequent passing.</t>
 <t id="15042">Seeking to alleviate the sense of isolation at the distant fringes of known space, Atreus strategically assumed control of a fresh sector in a more centrally located region. This move also granted them increased influence over the Lucky Planets Shipyard.</t>
 <t id="15043">Established in the aftermath of the Talonfire Rebellion, Credits Denied stands as the counterpart to Merchant Haven - the second set of gates on the southern side of the Gaian Badlands aimed at keeping the local pirate factions contained and out of Teladi space - and as such is usually bustling with military traffic or repair crews waiting to receive transports that have dared to brave the Maelstrom to bring supplies in from Grand Exchange.\n\nWhile also acting as a southern aegis against the pirate threat, Credits Denied has also been developed to become the main staging area for the Teladi Space Company should it ever wish to push through the Gaian Badlands and eradicate the corsair presence there, as well as being the hub for all of the Profit Guild's attempts to have the nearby independent sector join the fold.\n\nIt should also be noted that while the name &quot;Credits Denied&quot; was originally chosen as a symbolic message to the Gaian Pirates that they would find little profit in piracy in this sector, the name has since been hijacked and used against the Teladi Space Company via the registration of the name &quot;Transaction Denied&quot; for the independent sector to the north. \n\nSuch mockery has done little to weaken the resolve of the Teladi who are stationed in this area, however, who are notable for being a substantially harder and less personable breed than their counterparts.</t>
 <t id="15044">Primarily populated by refugees from the former colony of CEO's Reach, the Teladi Space Company used this sector to launch the hasty and ill-planned attempts to reclaim Talonfire after it fell to rebellion.\n\nNow that the dust has settled, the sector has become a popular tourist destination due to the estimated collision between the two planets of Hohindras and Rurandis, with the Teladi Space Company billing Overmaster's Talon as being &quot;the only place in the galaxy where you can watch worlds collide from the safety* of your own ship&quot;!\n\nThe legal documentation and disclaimers that follow the * are impressive even by Teladi standards.</t>
 <t id="15045">The Teladi Space Company lost control of this sector after a successful rebellion instigated by a female Teladi by the name of Raelisora Denarius III. \n\nWhile the establishment of a trade link between CEO's Reach and the previously distant Boron sector of Depth's of Silence promptly caused the sector's economy to flourish, with wealth came corruption of the kind that was perpetually fuelled by the avarice that spawned it; and as the distribution of that wealth shifted more and more to the minority, so did the division between the rich and the poor deepen. \n\nSeeking to end the huge divide and injustice between the rich and the poor once and for all, Raelisora lead her supporters in such a swift and glorious revolution that took the Teladi Space Company entirely by surprise. The population of CEO's Reach annexed the sector soon after, renaming it &quot;Talonfire&quot; in honour of the uprising that birthed it.\n\nWith Governor Raelisora III now in charge of the administration of the sector, Talonfire is defiantly independent, and intends to remain that way.</t>
 <t id="15046">Believed to be part of Kha'ak space, Tau Sigma is a mysterious and foreboding sector that it as once both terrifying as it is breath-taking. Thought to be hiding dark and terrible secrets within its nigh impenetrable depths, this is one region of space that even angels are reluctant to tread.</t>
 <t id="15047">Within the Paranid community, there is a prevalent belief that this sector holds the origins of an ancient Paranid Prophecy. Initially dismissed as a mere tale for the younger generation, its astonishing resemblance to the described sector led to a revelation. Swiftly, the Paranid asserted ownership of the sector, precluding any competing claimants.</t>
 <t id="15048">Although seemingly unremarkable, the Paranid laid claim to this sector, extending their borders to safeguard their Prophecy sector. Serving as a direct link to the Privateer Corridor, it grants the Paranid entry to the far eastern reaches of the known galaxy, a region previously challenging for them to access.</t>
 <t id="15049">With the help of both the Argon Federation and the Royal Kingdom of Boron, the Goner have established this sector as their &quot;Home Away From Home&quot;, and have directed their operations here towards the pursuit of knowledge and exploration. \n\nHere one can find a number of satellite production facilities for use in future expeditions, as well as a shipyard to provide those who wish to further the Goner's cause with the tools with which to do just that.\n\nWhile Elysium of Light remains the hub from which the Goner seek to preach the truth of Gunne's Crusade to ensure it lives on for all eternity, their colony upon Lightseeker is dedicated to the preservation of much of their written history and lore, and to that end is host to a number of impressive archives and libraries.</t>
 <t id="15050">Formerly under the dominion of the Split, this sector secured its independence following the decline of the Tharka family's influence among the Split, rendering them unable to maintain control. The other Split families opted not to assert ownership, deeming the sector lacking in strategic value.</t>
 <t id="15051">In a bid to avert a potential economic downturn resulting from ill-advised investments in Bad Debt, the Teladi Space Company made substantial investments in this sector to encourage sustained economic growth. Unfortunately, their investment proved unwise, and the sector faced economic challenges. Ultimately, they declared the sector independent. As a compromise, they permitted the Teladi to retain some factories to assist the neighboring sectors.</t>
 <t id="15052">Shadows End is the enigmatic home of the Assassins Guild, a sector veiled in mystery and danger. Encased within a luminous blue nebula, the sector's beauty is as deceiving as it is mesmerizing. The nebula's ethereal glow bathes the surrounding space, casting long shadows over the lush, verdant planet that serves as the heart of the Guild's operations. Despite its serene appearance, Shadows End is a place of calculated precision and ruthless efficiency, where only the most skilled and fearless can thrive. Hidden within the nebula, the Assassins Guild Headquarters stands as a testament to secrecy and power, an unseen fortress amidst the stars, from which deadly assignments are orchestrated and the fate of targets across the galaxy is sealed.</t>
 <t id="1030401">This outpost of basic installations acts as a resupply point for all Federation ships in the area. It produces only the basic products most required by small ships and installations. The system is the spiritual home of the popular Argon sport known as 'Hardball'.\n\nIn response to the closure of several sector gates, the Argon faction embarked on a deliberate and strategic overhaul of the affected sector. Seizing the opportunity presented by its increased isolation, the Argon ingeniously repurposed the area, envisioning a multifaceted transformation. At the heart of this evolution, they covertly established a secret service base dedicated to specialized operations. This clandestine facility serves as a pivotal hub for strategic initiatives and covert endeavors, strategically positioning the Argon to navigate the complexities of the altered galactic landscape with precision and effectiveness.</t>

The Alliance embraces all who seek refuge in their sectors, offering goods and ships to those with sufficient credits.

 <t id="10251">The Yaki faction, Beryll, operates on the outskirts of legality, renowned for their cunning and ruthless strategies. They've garnered a reputation as formidable adversaries, particularly in regions where law enforcement is lacking. Beryll's activities often center around piracy, smuggling, and other illicit endeavors. Despite their outlaw status, they maintain a close-knit network and wield advanced technology, rendering them a significant force in the shadowy realms of space.\n\nMoreover, the Beryll exhibit a fascination with AGI technology, including various Xenon research, much to the chagrin of other races. This has led to ongoing conflicts with all major factions, particularly the Terrans and ATF, given their suspected involvement in the destruction of Earth's Torus station.</t>

 <t id="100000">Ah, you must be the new cadet making waves. Welcome to Patrol Group Zeta. It seems your ship could use some enhancements. Dock at the trade station and perform a complete speed upgrade for your vessel.</t>
 <t id="100001">Fear not, cadet. I have some spare credits at your disposal for the speed upgrade, a valuable enhancement. If you find yourself short on credits, I recommend trying a few freelance jobs to bolster your funds.</t>
 <t id="100002">Excellent, now we can commence our patrol. No need to fret; this should be a relatively uneventful assignment. Our route is typically secure, providing a smooth and easy introduction. Just keep in close proximity to me.</t>
 <t id="100003">Ah there you are cadet, form up and stay close to me.</t>
 <t id="100004">Our patrol route involves navigating through the Home of Light sectors until we reach Argon Prime.</t>
 <t id="100005">As customary, it's exceptionally tranquil in this region. Let's proceed to the next sector.</t>
 <t id="100006">Just ahead of us is The TerraCorp Headquarters – I contemplated joining their ranks in my youth.</t>
 <t id="100007">Congratulations, cadet. Your inaugural patrol mission is concluded – I trust it wasn't too challenging for you.  Please come and talk to me.</t>
 <t id="100008">We're nearly there, cadet. Just one more sector to traverse.</t>
 <t id="100009">Observe that planet on the horizon – that's Kho's Haven, the place where I spent my formative years.</t>
 <t id="100010">That concludes our current tasks. I have other obligations at the moment. I recommend venturing out independently to accumulate additional credits. I will reach out to you when your next assignment is ready.</t>
 <t id="100011">Adios Cadet, till we meet again.</t>
 <t id="100012">We are on the verge of initiating our upcoming patrol, and this time, I anticipate a bit more action. I've noticed you've earned some credits; consider putting them to good use by further upgrading your ship.</t>
 <t id="100013">I took a bit of a beating out there, could you do me a solid an repair my ship.</t>
 <t id="100014">It appears your shields could benefit from an upgrade. Utilize the credits you've earned to enhance your shield capacity.</t>
 <t id="100015">This assignment is now concluded. I recommend upgrading your ship in preparation for the next mission. Consider acquiring an M4 fighter ship for optimal performance.</t>
 <t id="100016">This assignment has been completed. I will reach out to you once we are prepared for your next mission.</t>
 <t id="100017">Our patrol will bring us in proximity to Pirate territory as we make our way to the military outpost in Elena's Fortune. This serves as Zeta's primary base of operations.</t>
 <t id="100018">During my initial assignment to Zeta Patrol, this sector was the primary focus. However, following our successful reclaiming of Elena's Fortune from the pirates, our base of operations shifted there. This strategic move aids in safeguarding the border to pirate space.</t>
 <t id="100019">The tragedy in Presidents End occurred before my tenure, but the collective memory still echoes the devastation caused by those accursed Kha'ak, laying waste to the unfortunate inhabitants. It's heartening to witness the gradual restoration of some of its former splendor.</t>
 <t id="100020">Now, we find ourselves in Elena's Fortune, a sector marking the border to pirate space, making it a consistently active area for us. Our destination is the Alpha sector, home to the Military Outpost.</t>
 <t id="100021">Salutations, pilot. We are in constant search of adept combat veterans to bolster our ranks. There's an administration fee of 30,000 credits, and upon payment, we'll assign you a task to assess your prowess. Does this proposition still pique your interest?</t>
 <t id="100022">Excellent, pilot. You've progressed a step closer to becoming one of us. Next, I propose to observe your performance during one of our patrols to assess your worthiness.</t>
 <t id="100023">Congratulations, private. You have attained full membership status in Patrol Group Zeta. Explore the various military outposts to discover additional tasks awaiting you. Until our paths cross again.</t>
 <t id="100024">We've scheduled another standard patrol, but this time, we intend to venture into Pirate territory. There have been reports of pirates harassing traders, and it's crucial that we investigate.</t>
 <t id="100025">Hold on, what's happening over there? It seems a trader is under assault. Advance and provide protection.</t>
 <t id="100026">No worries pilot, the Argon Military has your back, we will protect you while you get back to Argon space.</t>
 <t id="100027">Ok, lets move out and escort this trader.</t>
 <t id="100028">Quite an eventful patrol we had. For now, our mission is complete. I'll reach out to you later with our next assignment. Best of luck out there.</t>
 <t id="100029">Ah, pilot, there you are. We've received numerous recent reports of trader attacks. Our objective is to thoroughly investigate this matter.</t> 
 <t id="100030">Lately, there has been a notable increase in suspicious activities around the border sectors. The Boron share our concerns and have reached out to us for collaboration.</t> 
 <t id="100031">Our next destination is the Atreus Clouds, where we'll persist in our investigation. Stay vigilant for any traders facing difficulties along the way.</t>
 <t id="100032">Good heavens, is that the wreckage of a trader vessel? We ought to investigate this.</t>
 <t id="100033">It appears a trader has been destroyed, with no signs of survivors. Approach and conduct a thorough scan of the wreckage; we need to unravel the events that transpired here.</t>
 <t id="100034">Certainly obliterated by weapons fire, yet I'm unfamiliar with the weapon signatures. I'll transmit the scan data for additional analysis. Lets continue to Atreus Clouds.</t>
 <t id="100035">Your current assignment concludes here; I will reach out to you once the results of the scan analysis are in. Stay vigilant, pilot.</t>
 <t id="100036">Nice to see you out this way pilot, we have some more suspicious activity to investigate out here.</t> 
 <t id="100037">We've received the report on the weapons responsible for the trader's attack, and unfortunately, the news isn't promising—they remain unknown to us. Our next step is to gather more information to uncover the truth behind this situation.</t> 
 <t id="100038">While I don't frequent this sector regularly, it's an ideal location to acquire new ships if you're seeking an upgrade.</t> 
 <t id="100039">Hold on! Those appear to be Terran ships. What brings them so far out here, and who are they engaging with? We should approach and establish communication.</t>
 <t id="100040">Curses! They've jumped away. This situation is becoming increasingly peculiar. Let's regroup back at the Military Outpost to assess the unfolding events.</t>
 <t id="100041">I can't fathom why the Terrans ventured so far from their home sectors. They must have a damn good reason to be present in Argon Space.</t>
 <t id="100042">We must initiate a parley with the Terrans to ascertain the precise nature of their presence here.  I'm sending you to go and speak to them.</t>
 <t id="100043">Navigate to the Omicron Lyrae system; we've coordinated diplomats to accompany you into Terran Space. This approach should facilitate your interaction with the Terrans. Assist them in their missions to gain trust, and we'll subsequently organize a formal meeting.</t>
 <t id="100044">We believe you have been doing some work for the Terrans already, continue with this to gain their trust, and we'll subsequently organize a formal meeting.</t>
 <t id="100045">We know you have worked with the Terrans in the past, we can use the Trust you earned with them to organize a formal meeting.</t>
 <t id="100046">I understand, pilot, but we must attempt it. Earn sufficient reputation with the Terrans to open communication channels. Once achieved, we'll coordinate a meeting in neutral territory.</t>
 <t id="100047">Now that you can reach the Earth Torus, your task is to engage with an ATF contact and inquire about their activities in Argon Space. They'll only divulge this information to you.</t>
 <t id="100048">So what did you find out from the Terrans?</t>
 <t id="100049">The Beryll? There have been murmurs about Beryll sightings lately. We require additional assistance, so I will contact some associates. Stay tuned; I will notify you once I gather more information.</t>
 <t id="100050">Pleasure to encounter you, pilot. Our current mission involves probing additional Beryll sightings, aiming to pinpoint their origin.</t>
 <t id="100051">Upon discovering Beryll involvement, we've re-evaluated the weapon signatures, and our revised analysis confirms the Beryll's connection to these assaults.</t>
 <t id="100052">Numerous reports indicate Beryll attacks in this region. Our objective is to locate Beryll ships and track their movements.</t>
 <t id="100053">Bullseye! A Beryll ship spotted. We must tail it—maintain a safe distance.</t>
 <t id="100054">Wait!! Where did they go?  That didn't seem like they used their jump engines.</t>
 <t id="100055">This is getting stranger and stranger. I'm not sure how they managed to escape. We need more help here. Let me investigate this, and I will contact you later with more information.</t>
 <t id="100056">Where are you headed, pilot? You were supposed to follow the Beryll ship.</t>
 <t id="100057">I have another assignment for you pilot, please come find me.</t>
 <t id="100058">I have discussed the situation with the Argon Secret Service, and we have formulated a plan to continue our investigation. Let's rendezvous with them now.</t>
 <t id="100059">We will head to Ringo Moon. Since the recent gate shutdowns, the sector has become more isolated, making it the perfect location for a new secret service base.</t>
 <t id="100060">Ok pilot, lets wait here for our contact.</t>
 <t id="100061">Ah pilot, let me introduce you to my contact, Brent.</t>
 <t id="100062">That sounds quite dangerous. Are you certain about this?</t>
 <t id="100063">Very well, I trust your judgment, but please, do your best to keep them safe. So, where do we begin?</t>
 <t id="100064">So what will you have us do?</t>
 <t id="100065">You heard him pilot. Dock at the Secret Service base to collect the equipment, then head out to Shore of Infinity. I will meet you there.</t>
 <t id="100066">We've arrived at the Shore of Infinity. Stay vigilant for any Beryll ships. Let's commence the patrol.</t>
 <t id="100067">There we have it, another Beryll vessel. Move closer and initiate a scan on the ship.</t>
 <t id="100068">That's it pilot. Scan complete. Now let's head back to Ringo Moon.</t>
 <t id="100069">Glad to be working with you again, Sergeant.</t>
 <t id="100070">That doesn't sound promising. What exactly were their beliefs?</t>
 <t id="100071">This is truly concerning; we must put an end to their actions.</t>
 <t id="100072">Then we need to figure out how to replicate this technology so we can track them down.</t>
 <t id="100073">Zeta Patrol will assist you, Sergeant. Let's get moving.</t>
 <t id="100074">Alright, Sergeant. The first sector is Aladna Hill—I'll meet you there.</t>
 <t id="100075">Here we are, time to deploy the spy satellite.</t>
 <t id="100076">Next, we need to head to President's End.</t>
 <t id="100077">Ok, onward to Shore of Infinity.</t>
 <t id="100078">Now we need to make our way to Cloudbase South West.</t>
 <t id="100079">Finally, we need to head to Queen's Space.</t>
 <t id="100080">That's it—all the spy satellites have been deployed. Now it's time to start fishing.</t>
 <t id="100081">We've detected something in Cloudbase South West—meet me there.</t>
 <t id="100082">There might be something in Aladna Hill—let's check it out.</t>
 <t id="100083">Another contact detected—head to Shore of Infinity.</t>
 <t id="100084">Bingo! We’ve spotted a Beryll ship. Let’s get closer to use the scanner, but not too close—we don’t want to spook them.</t>
 <t id="100085">Damn it, it’s gone again. It must have passed through a wormhole. Let’s hope the scanner was able to pick up something.</t>
 <t id="100086">Keep your distance—pull back a bit.</t>
 <t id="100087">They’re gone—you got too close and spooked them.</t>
 <t id="100088">You're moving too far away—get closer.</t>
 <t id="100089">They're gone—you've lost track of them.</t>
 <t id="300000">Greetings, pilot. While your contributions to our war efforts have been significant, we now require you to demonstrate your unwavering loyalty to the Argon cause. We have several critical missions for you, all involving strikes against the Terrans.</t>
 <t id="300001">Excellent work, pilot. Report back to me for your next assignment.</t>
 <t id="300002">Your next mission involves eliminating high-priority Terran targets. You'll be operating within Terran Core sectors, which will be extremely hostile territory for you.</t>
 <t id="300003">With those targets eliminated, continue supporting our efforts against the Terran.</t>

 <t id="100000">Hello Cadet, congratulations on successfully completing your training. I request your presence for a discussion; find me at the trading station.</t>
 <t id="100001">Ah, there you are, cadet. Now that your training is concluded, it's time for the actual duties. Your initial assignment involves joining a patrol squad, but before that, I must ensure you are adequately prepared.</t>
 <t id="100002">I require a demonstration of your combat skills. I will deploy a set of drones; your task is to eliminate them.</t>
 <t id="100003">Outstanding effort, cadet. You are now prepared to join your patrol group. In case your ship sustained damage, ensure its repair by ejecting into your space suit and utilizing the repair laser.</t>
 <t id="100004">Your subsequent task involves linking up with your patrol leader, who awaits you in Home of Light Gamma. Best of luck, cadet.</t>
 <t id="100005">Here it comes, watch yourself</t>
 <t id="100006">Great job, please return for further discussion.</t>
 <t id="100010">Hello, pilot. I understand you're curious about our presence in Argon Space. I'm an ATF agent, currently conducting an investigation into peculiar AGI sightings. These instances bear a resemblance to the old #deca ships, but there's something distinctly unusual about them.</t>
 <t id="100011">Certainly, pilot. We pursued several of these vessels into Argon space, where we encountered them in combat.</t>
 <t id="100012">The details are unclear at the moment, but there seems to be a potential connection to another faction. While on our journey, we identified a ship affiliated with the Beryll, leading us to suspect their involvement in some way.</t>
 <t id="100013">Regrettably, our current capacity for assistance is limited. I recommend initiating an investigation into these reported Beryll sightings.</t>
 <t id="100100">It's good to have you here, hunter. We've got incoming pirates; lend us your hand in dealing with them.</t>
 <t id="100101">That's all of them. Thank you for your assistance; we can handle the rest from here.</t>
 <t id="100200">Greetings pilot, how can the Argon Military help you?</t>
 <t id="100201">Are you certain you want to resign your commission? If you decide to rejoin, you'll need to start over as an Enlistee.</t>
 <t id="200000">Welcome, pilot. Today, your flight school training will cover the fundamental aspects of piloting a spacecraft. To begin, you should establish communication with your instructor, who is currently navigating a ship within this sector. Identify them through the distinctive icon positioned above their spacecraft.\n\nThis identifying icon is also visible on the sector map, facilitating your search for the instructor. The various icons you observe signify available missions. In the case of the flight instructor, their icon resembles a book, indicating a plot or, in this instance, the tutorial mission.\n\nFeel free to locate your instructor and initiate communication with them for further instructions. Happy flying.</t>
 <t id="200001">Ok pilot, now you have the basics, contact me for some additional training.</t>
 <t id="300000">Greetings, pilot. While your contributions to our war efforts have been significant, we now require you to demonstrate your unwavering loyalty to the Terran cause. We have several critical missions for you, all involving strikes against the Argon.</t>

 <t id="100000">Nice to see you again, Ulla. This must be your new protégé.</t>
 <t id="100001">The plan is to send you undercover with the Beryll to gather as much information as you can.</t>
 <t id="100002">We have no choice, Ulla. We need to find out what's going on, and this is our only option.</t>
 <t id="100003">Before you go undercover, pilot, we have another assignment. We need Zeta to patrol for more Beryll sightings. We have a new scanning device that we'll install to gather more information.</t>
 <t id="100004">We've received several reports of activity near the Shore of Infinity. Your mission is to patrol the area and utilize the scanning device. Avoid engagement and return here upon completion.</t>
 <t id="100005">The scanner is installed to your ship and ready to go.  If you plan to use another ship, remember to transfer the scanner over.</t>
 <t id="100006">Welcome back, pilot. The data from the scanner will be invaluable. Now, we need you to infiltrate the Beryll.</t>
 <t id="100007">First, you will need to build your reputation with the Yaki and gain access to their capital, Tortuga's Retreat. From there, you can investigate the Beryll further.</t>
 <t id="100008">Yes, this is crucial. You will be operating undercover, and no one will know you're working for us. As a result, any Argon Military personnel will see you as an enemy. Do whatever it takes to maintain your cover.</t>
 <t id="100009">Ah, there you are, cadet. We have something that we believe will help you gain favour with the Beryll.</t>
 <t id="100010">It's called the Spacelab Headquarters, a unique new station you can use as your base of operations. The headquarters also enables you to hire diplomats who can help improve your reputation.</t>
 <t id="100011">We're loading it onto a TL ship at the Argon Prime Shipyard. Head there and instruct the captain where you want it deployed.</t>
 <t id="100020">Nice to see you again pilot, this must be your Beryll contact?</t>
 <t id="100021">That’s promising. What else can you share about this splinter faction?</t>
 <t id="100022">Understood. We’ll analyze all the information and see what we find. What are you hoping to achieve from this?</t>
 <t id="100023">Certainly, we can agree to that in exchange for your continued assistance.</t>
 <t id="100024">Alright, pilot, we will review this information and reach out to you once we have a plan in place.</t>
 <t id="100025">Good to see you again, Sergeant. We need to look into this splinter faction and determine what they're up to and where they're located.</t>
 <t id="100026">It's great to have you here, Yvona. I've also brought in Zeta Flight to assist us.</t>
 <t id="100027">We've discovered that a Beryll cell split off to establish its own faction and has been targeting traders for a while. What more can you tell us, Yvona?</t>
 <t id="100028">So, they might be attempting to assist the Xenon or even expand their numbers.</t>
 <t id="100029">How are they able to keep a sector hidden?</t>
 <t id="100030">If it's unstable, how could they use it to access their sector?</t>
 <t id="100031">I believe the best course of action is to locate and scan their ships to see if we can reverse engineer their devices</t>
 <t id="100032">That sounds promising; we will continue our research. In the meantime, I'd like you to deploy new spy satellites capable of detecting the presence of their ships. We also have a new scanner you can use to gather information from their vessels. It was initially designed for use against the Terrans, but it should be effective here as well.</t>
 <t id="100033">We've been monitoring the situation and believe we may be able to use a Low Frequency Locator to detect a potential hyperspace relay.</t>
 <t id="100034">Alright, that’s sorted. We’ll begin constructing a Trans-Orbital Accelerator so everyone can pass through.</t>
 <t id="100035">Looks like there’s nothing here. We’ll head back and analyze the data. We’ll contact you later, Sergeant.</t>
 <t id="110001">Welcome, pilot. We seek combat veterans to join our ranks. An administration fee of 40,000 credits is required. Upon payment, we'll assign you a task to evaluate your skills. Are you interested?</t>
 <t id="110002">Excellent, pilot. You are close to joining our esteemed ranks. First, we need to test your abilities. I've assigned you a new patrol route to demonstrate your skills.</t>
 <t id="110003">Congratulations, Private. You've officially joined the ranks of the Terran Military. Welcome to Patrol Lambda. Seek further assignments at the various outposts across Terran space.</t>
 <t id="110004">Greetings pilot, What can the Terran Military do for you?</t>
 <t id="110005">Are you certain you want to resign your commission? If you decide to rejoin, you'll need to start over as an Enlistee.</t>
 <t id="110006">Greetings, Corporal. Our next assignment is urgent. We've received reports of multiple attacks on our ships in Commonwealth space. Your mission is to protect our vessels and ensure the safe recovery of our pilots.</t>
 <t id="110007">We're jumping to Elysium of Light, meet us there Corporal.  Make sure you have a cargo life support system in case we need to pickup any pilots.</t>
 <t id="110008">Glad you could join us, Corporal. We're planning to scout this sector and search for our missing pilots. Stay alert and keep your eyes open.</t>
 <t id="110009">Then lets check it out. Lambda flight: head to the west and investigate.</t>
 <t id="110010">Looks like they ejected just in time. Corporal, go rescue our stranded pilot.</t>
 <t id="110011">Alright, Corporal, let's get them back to the outpost in Saturn.</t>
 <t id="110012">Thank you for your help, Corporal. We’ll be in touch with your next assignment soon.</t>
 <t id="110013">Corporal, we have your next assignment. After debriefing the pilot you rescued, we've detected a rise in terraformer activity. These units are not like the Xenon, but more akin to the original terraformers. We need to locate their origin.</t>
 <t id="110014">Alright, Corporal, we have several sectors to scout. We'll begin in Elysium of Light. Rendezvous with us there.</t>
 <t id="110015">Neither do I</t>
 <t id="110016">Right, lets try the next sector</t>
 <t id="110017">Keep scanning</t>
 <t id="110018">It looks like some kind of wreck, we should scan it.</t>
 <t id="110019">No signs of terraformers detected, but this data will be valuable. We should proceed with an analysis.</t>
 <t id="110020">Lets head back to Saturn.</t>
 <t id="110021">Analysing this data might take some time. We’ll reach out to you once your next assignment is ready.</t>
 <t id="110022">Alright, Corporal, let's begin the scouting mission. Keep your scanners ready.</t>
 <t id="110023">Lets continue with the scouting</t>
 <t id="110024">Welcome back, Sergeant. We've encountered a roadblock in our investigation and could use your help. We've identified several key individuals from the Commonwealth races who might be able to assist. Your task is to gather them for us.  I will send you the contact details.</t>
 <t id="110025">Outstanding, Sergeant. Their knowledge will significantly aid our research objectives.</t>
 <t id="110026">Stand down for now. We require time to finalize the next phase. You’ll receive new orders when the operation resumes.</t>
 <t id="110027">Pilot, your recent efforts have uncovered something extraordinary — wreckage of Xenon ships and a damaged gate, hidden deep in the lost colony sectors. This could be the key to understanding what happened to the Pioneers.</t>
 <t id="110028">Your mission is clear: find and scan these wrecks, extract whatever data you can, and prepare for what lies ahead. The future of the Pioneers depends on it.</t>
 <t id="110029">Sergeant, we’ve completed the analysis of the debris you recovered. What we’ve found... is unexpected.  The materials are from an old Terraformer ship design — not Terran, but definitely of early human origin.</t>
 <t id="110030">Its construction and technology date back to a much earlier era, long lost to our history.  High Command has classified the incident and issued orders for a thorough investigation. You have been assigned to this operation.</t>
 <t id="110031">There’s a theory gaining traction — one that’s hard to believe. Some in Command think we may have uncovered evidence of the Lost Colonies.</t>
 <t id="110032">Long ago, during the first waves of human colonization, several pioneer missions were sent out. These explorers vanished without a trace.  Most assumed they were lost to accidents or the Xenon. But what you found suggests something else.</t>
 <t id="110033">I know this is unexpected, but you’ve proven capable. Earth needs you on this mission.  Your new orders are to join lambda patrol to investigate this further.  This operation is classified. Discuss it with no one outside this circle.</t>
 <t id="110034">They knew something was coming. Whatever forced this ship off the grid... it left them no options. High Command will want to see this.</t>
 <t id="110035">We’ve gone over the logs. The ship was part of an unsanctioned expedition. No record in High Command’s files. But the technology… it's Terran, just old. Too old.</t>
 <t id="110036">That initiative was classified. We believed they were all lost after the gate collapse. If even a fragment of their colonies survived…</t>
 <t id="110037">You'll be working with Specialist Roe. She’s well versed in these black-site archives and has invaluable insights.</t>
 <t id="110038">You’ll need to travel to several sectors and persuade the scientists to help. Expect complications. These aren’t your average researchers.</t>
 <t id="110039">Find them. Convince them. The future of Terran history might depend on what they uncover.</t>
 <t id="110040">We've been going through the recovered telemetry from the wreck you scanned in the last mission. It’s... old.</t>
 <t id="110041">I mean really old. Early Terraformer-era tech. Possibly even older.</t>
 <t id="110042">Which brings us to your next assignment.</t>
 <t id="110043">There are possible gate remnants in the outer sectors. Our scans indicate old Terraformer debris and warped subspace trails nearby.</t>
 <t id="110044">Head out. Locate the wreckage. Scan for targeting residue. If we can find coordinates, we may be able to establish a jump path to whatever’s left behind the gate.</t>
 <t id="110045">Let’s bring the Pioneers home.</t>
 <t id="110046">First stop on our search. This sector was once mapped by early Terran scouts, but little survived from that era. The Pioneers passed through here—follow your waypoint and let’s see what history left behind.</t>
 <t id="110047">Segaris… it’s seen a lot of change since the Gate Shutdown. Some say the Pioneers tried to establish a supply route through here. Check the marked location, if they left wreckage, it may tell us more.</t>
 <t id="110048">This region's under the shadow of Darkspace now. They're not officially hostile, but don’t expect a warm welcome. If the Pioneers hid something out here, odds are Darkspace already knows about it—and might not want us finding it.</t>
 <t id="110049">These coordinates were flagged during long-range scans. The wreck we're looking for is old—likely predating the current Xenon evolution cycle.</t>
 <t id="110050">According to the logs, the Pioneers fought to the last. They weren’t just cut off—they were sacrificing everything to protect what they’d built.</t>
 <t id="110051">Keep your eyes open. There may be more than wreckage out here… the Xenon rarely leave anything untouched.</t>
 <t id="110052">That’s a negative. No wreckage, no signal drift… nothing that points to Pioneer activity. Just empty space and old ghost echoes.  Mark the search as inconclusive. Let’s move to the next sector, we might have better luck there.</t>
 <t id="110053">No usable wreckage here either. The signs of a battle are faint at best, if they exist at all.  This sector might’ve seen skirmishes, but if the Pioneers left anything behind, it’s well hidden. Let’s push forward to the next location.</t>
 <t id="110054">Contact! The wreck’s right where the scans predicted. Hull signature matches Pioneer-class frigate.  We’ll need to scan thoroughly and extract what data we can. This could be the key to unlocking the Pioneers’ fate.</t>
 <t id="110055">Scan complete. We've gathered all available data from the wreck. Head back to Saturn Outpost for analysis and next orders.</t> 
 <t id="110056">Good work out there. The data we recovered confirms what we suspected, the Pioneers fought a desperate battle before sealing off their gate.</t>
 <t id="110057">This wreck tells a story of sacrifice and survival, hidden away in the shadow of Darkspace's influence.</t>
 <t id="110058">Prepare yourself. The next phase will require precision and resolve.</t>
 <t id="110059">We’ve narrowed it down. An anomaly in the Althes system, drift patterns, subspace echoes. It’s almost certainly a gate wreck, likely from Pioneer times.</t>
 <t id="110060">Althes itself is unusual. It was overlooked during the original Terran expansion, only discovered long after the Pioneers vanished. No records. No reason. Someone altered its gate links long ago... and not by accident.</t>
 <t id="110061">This whole sector’s a curiosity. No patrol records. No known habitation. Almost like it was erased from the map on purpose.</t>
 <t id="110062">There it is... or what’s left of it. The architecture's definitely Terran. Old model, pre-Earth secession era. The core’s cracked open like an egg.</t>
 <t id="110063">Blast patterns suggest an internal overload. This wasn’t an external hit, it was shut down from the inside. Deliberate. Controlled.</t>
 <t id="110064">The signal's weak. We won’t get clean telemetry from inside the cockpit. You’ll need to EVA, get close and scan it manually.</t>
 <t id="110065">Excellent work, Commander. We'll review the data and formulate our next steps. Stand by for further orders.</t>
 <t id="110066">Commander, welcome back. We've reviewed your scans from the Althes wreck. Our engineers have successfully repaired the gate's structure, but there's a problem.</t>
 <t id="110067">The routing matrix inside the gate's core is incomplete. We can't initialize a connection without a valid destination vector. If we guess wrong... well, let's just say it wouldn't end well.</t>
 <t id="110068">This mission won't be easy. You'll be alone, deep in space, with no comm support if the jump fails. But if we're going to re-establish this corridor... this is our only option.</t>
 <t id="110069">You're cleared for launch. Make it back with that data, Commander.</t>
 <t id="110070">Commander, you'll need an Unfocused Jumpdrive to proceed — seek out to the Goners, they're your best lead.</t>
 <t id="110071">Good work, Commander. The targeting data you recovered has been authenticated and cross-checked against the gate’s harmonics.</t>
 <t id="110072">We’ve uploaded the coordinates to the Althes gate. Roe has confirmed the alignment is stable, we now have a clear path to whatever lies on the other side.</t>
 <t id="110073">However, Command has decided not to activate the gate just yet. We need time to run full simulations, secure support assets, and prepare for whatever we might encounter.</t>
 <t id="110074">You're free to stand down for now, Commander. Use this time to resupply or handle any outstanding assignments.</t>
 <t id="110075">When we're ready to proceed with the gate activation, you'll be the first to know. Keep your channels open.</t>
 <t id="110076">Good to have you with us, Commander. The team is ready to begin the mission. Rendezvous with us in Althes.</t>
 <t id="110077">All right, Commander. The team is assembled and our jump formation is set.</t>
 <t id="110078">This is a historic moment. We have authorization to proceed through the gate. Your ship will lead the group.</t>
 <t id="110079">Once we're through, stay alert. We have no idea what condition the other side is in, or who might be waiting.</t>
 <t id="110080">We're through. Scanners are online... It's quiet. Too quiet. Just a handful of structures, mining outposts, by the look of it.</t>
 <t id="110081">We’ve got a lock on the signal — it's a gate, east of this sector. No need to return. Proceed through when you’re ready. We’ll follow your lead.</t>
 <t id="110082">My god... it’s real. A whole world, alive and thriving. After all this time...</t>
 <t id="110083">Commander, we've received word from Lt. Maera on Terra Nova. She has your next assignment ready. Proceed to Terra Nova and report to her at the Orbital Defence Station.</t>

 <t id="100000">Greetings, cadet. The Spacelab Headquarters is loaded and ready for deployment. Just let me know where you would like it to be positioned.</t>
 <t id="110000">I hear you've been seeking a meeting with the Beryll. What can we assist you with?</t>
 <t id="110001">Yes, we’re aware of these incidents. However, it’s not the Beryll behind them. A splinter faction broke away from Mists of Artemis to establish their own group. They’re the ones responsible for the incursions, and we want to put an end to their activities.</t>
 <t id="110002">Unfortunately, we don’t have that information. We know they’ve discovered a hidden sector and are using it as their base, but its location remains unknown. What we do know is that they’ve been experimenting with wormholes, and the sector is likely accessible only through one of these portals.</t>
 <t id="110003">No, the wormhole to Mists of Artemis is one of the few stable ones. However, there are many unstable wormholes with shifting entry and exit points. It's likely that one end of the wormhole is anchored in their new sector, while the other end moves unpredictably. I’m sure they have a method for tracking its location.</t>
 <t id="110004">We had our suspicions, and we’re eager to assist. We’re willing to offer our support to the Argon Secret Service. Could you arrange a meeting to discuss the next steps?</t>
 <t id="110005">Yes, I’m Yvona Jovi from the Beryll, here to offer my assistance.</t>
 <t id="110006">We’re sending you the information we have on wormholes and recent sightings. Hopefully, your team can glean more insights from it.</t>
 <t id="110007">All we request is that, once the faction is dealt with, we retain ownership of their sector.</t>
 <t id="110008">I've arrived in Argon space to offer my assistance with this issue. This faction poses a threat to all of us.</t>
 <t id="110009">They were expelled from the Mists of Artemis because of their extreme beliefs.</t>
 <t id="110010">We view the Xenon as fascinating technology to study, but they took their experiments too far and began worshiping them as gods</t>
 <t id="110011">That won’t be easy. We haven’t been able to locate them yet, but we suspect they might have a hidden sector somewhere.</t>
 <t id="110012">As you know, our home is concealed behind a wormhole. We believe their sector is similarly hidden, though likely behind a more unstable wormhole, which is why we haven’t been able to locate it.</t>
 <t id="110013">We've been conducting experiments with wormholes, so it's possible they've advanced this technology and may have equipment to detect or even control wormholes.</t>
 <t id="110014">We'll share all our data on wormholes with your scientists.</t>
 <t id="120000">I'm picking up something on my scanners, over to the west.</t>

 <t id="100000">Greetings hunter, glad you could join us. As you know, we aim to claim this sector for the Guild. To achieve this, we need to employ diplomacy. Your first task is to send your agent to register our interest in the sector.</t>
 <t id="100001">To claim a sector, you need to send one of your agents to a Privateer dock. The Privateer Independence Alliance oversees the ownership of new sectors and mediates the claiming process between various factions.</t>
 <t id="100002">Hunter, we received confirmation of the sector claim, well done.</t>
 <t id="100003">Next, we need to earn some favour to improve our chances of claiming the sector. There are several Yaki ships in the area, clear them out.</t>
 <t id="100004">Excellent, that should significantly boost our standing among the other claimants.</t>
 <t id="100005">To monitor your progress, you can use diplomacy to check the current status of the sector. Try that now to see how our competition is doing.</t>
 <t id="100006">It seems we have some competition for the sector, and they're already in the advanced stages of their claims. Our best chance might be to persuade them to drop their claim, as catching up doesn't seem feasible.</t>
 <t id="100007">First, focus on the Paranid. Use diplomacy to persuade them to drop their claim.  You may need to get friendly and earn some diplomatic bonuses before you can proceed.</t>
 <t id="100008">It seems the Paranid have withdrawn their claim, making things easier for us now.</t>
 <t id="100009">To strengthen our claim, let's work on persuading the Argon to support us.</t>
 <t id="100010">That support will definitely bolster our claim.</t>
 <t id="100011">Next, let's turn our attention to the Split. I've contacted our guild associates and they persuaded the Split to consider dropping their claim. However, they have a task for us to complete before they agree.</t>
 <t id="100012">Excellent, I have received word about the Split dropping their claim.</t>
 <t id="100013">The only obstacle left is the pirates. I've tried reaching out, but they haven't responded. We'll need to take a different approach. Your mission is to do what you do best, assassinate several key pirate leaders until they’re persuaded.</t>
 <t id="100014">Well done, assassin. The sector is now under our control, and we can begin relocating our operations. Thank you for all your assistance.</t>
 <t id="110000">I'm Specialist Roe. I've seen telemetry like this before, buried deep in black-site archives. References to an early colonization project, the 'Terran Pioneers.' They left Earth to establish independent settlements beyond the gate network, before the Terraformers went rogue.</t>
 <t id="110001">We'll need more than Terran resources. There are alien experts who’ve studied ancient gate phenomena. I’ve compiled a shortlist.</t>
 <t id="110002">There is Dr. Gululu Bo, a Boron researcher in xenophysics. High Deacon Ramanckosset of the Paranid, who holds... unusual views. And Mira Selis, an exiled Argon scientist with a past in piracy.  I will send you the details of where to find them.</t>
 <t id="110003">That’s right. I’ve verified some of the signal protocols. The design architecture is consistent with the earliest Terran deep-space expeditionary ships.</t>
 <t id="110004">Some of this aligns with old models we only had theories about. These ships didn’t come from anywhere in our known jump network.</t>
 <t id="110005">I believe we’re dealing with remnants from the Lost Colonies, the Terran Pioneers who were sent to explore and settle beyond the frontier before the gate collapse.</t>
 <t id="110006">If they survived, they might still be out there. Isolated. Self-reliant. Possibly advanced in ways we can't predict.</t>
 <t id="110007">The cut gate could explain why no one’s heard from them for so long, they severed the connection to protect themselves... maybe from the Xenon.</t>
 <t id="110008">The data is complex and fragmented. We’ll need time to fully analyze the findings and extract usable coordinates.</t>
 <t id="110009">Come back later, once we’ve processed the information. Until then, stand by for further orders.</t>
 <t id="110010">Telemetry confirms a fractured jump gate core. It’s faint, but still transmitting residual data. If the nav buffer survived, we might find where it once connected.</t>
 <t id="110011">Get in close, run a deep scan, and bring the results home. We need to know whether the Pioneers shut themselves off, or if something forced their hand.</t>
 <t id="110012">Data received. You got closer than I expected. Impressive work, pilot.</t>
 <t id="110013">The gate core was breached from within, controlled overload confirmed. This wasn't an accident. Someone shut it down with precision.</t>
 <t id="110014">What’s more… I’ve isolated a decayed coordinate string. It’s degraded, but I can partially reconstruct where this gate used to connect.</t>
 <t id="110015">We’ll need to run deeper analysis back at Saturn. Bring the scan logs and telemetry in as soon as you’re ready.</t>
 <t id="110016">Based on your data, I managed to isolate a faint signal encoded in the wreck's residual harmonics. It points to what we believe was once a Pioneer relay station, located deep beyond the mapped jump network.</t>
 <t id="110017">It's not a colony, as far as we can tell. More likely, a waystation, a place used to recalibrate or redirect long-range jumps between frontier sectors.</t>
 <t id="110018">We’ll need someone to jump there and retrieve the original targeting data. I’ve modified your Unfocused Jumpdrive with a custom seed based on the signal. With luck, it’ll land you close enough to begin a search.</t>
 <t id="110019">Frankly, I didn’t expect the relay to still be functional after all this time. The data signature was degraded, but recoverable, just barely.</t>
 <t id="110020">This confirms the Pioneers were deliberately creating long-range corridor chains, likely to isolate themselves from the Xenon threat. If so... the next sector could hold far more than we anticipated.</t>
 <t id="110021">I’ll continue reviewing the data until then. Something tells me we’re only scratching the surface of what the Pioneers built.</t>
 <t id="110022">I still can't believe we’ve come this far. This gate matches the engineering signatures of early Pioneer teams — we’re about to uncover a piece of Terran history sealed away for centuries.</t>
 <t id="110023">No active comms traffic. Power readings are minimal. These stations haven't seen maintenance in decades... maybe centuries.</t>
 <t id="110024">Atmosphere is stable, orbital infrastructure is operational, and... I’m reading active IFF signatures. This colony never died.</t>

 <t id="100000">I am Jennaia of the Yaki, i've heard you may be interested in joining us?</t>
 <t id="100001">As it turns out, we're in need of skilled pilots to assist us. Our smuggling operations have encountered some obstacles recently—the Paranid have deployed new scanner technology that can penetrate our cargo bay shielding. We need to put an end to this. If you can join our escorts and help protect them, you might have to get your hands dirty with the Paranid.</t>
 <t id="100002">Ok pilot, meet us in Priest Refuge</t>
 <t id="100003">Glad you could join us, pilot. We’re about to start the escort, and we’re anticipating some trouble along the way, so stay alert.</t>
 <t id="100004">Phew, we made it here, lets meet at the local station.</t>
 <t id="100005">We are just on our way to Unseen domain with a shipment of Ore, we don't want any trouble</t>
 <t id="100006">This doesn't look good pilot, prepare for trouble.</t>
 <t id="100007">Go to hell Paranid scum!!</t>
 <t id="100008">Pilot, Attack them, we need to allow the freighter to make their escape.</t>
 <t id="100009">Looks like we were right about their new scanners, this is troubling indeed.  We are almost there, just need to get to the next sector.</t>
 <t id="100010">Welcome to Anacreon's Kingdom. These sectors are part of our new territory, claimed when the gates shifted, much to the frustration of the Paranid.</t>
 <t id="100011">Lets carry on pilot, hopefully the rest of the journey will be uneventful.</t>
 <t id="100012">This sector is swarming with border patrol ships; stick close to the freighter.</t>
 <t id="100013">Yes, thank you for your help, pilot. You are now a friend of the Yaki. There are more tasks available if you're interested. Good luck out there.</t>
 <t id="100014">You can find various tasks in Yaki space; complete them, and we can arrange a meeting with our leaders.</t>
 <t id="110000">Unidentified vessel, you are entering Pioneer sovereign space. This region is under isolation mandate. State your intentions immediately.</t>
 <t id="110001">Earth? That... is not possible. Earth was lost to us. We've had no contact in centuries.</t>
 <t id="110002">You claim to be from Earth, and now a diplomatic envoy? This is hard to accept.</t>
 <t id="110003">But... we are not in a position to dismiss help. Our food reserves are in decline. Infrastructure is failing. If this is not a trick, then perhaps... there is reason to talk.</t>
 <t id="110004">I will escort you to our orbital defence station. There, we will speak further under Council oversight.</t>
 <t id="110005">Welcome aboard, Envoy. I speak on behalf of the Pioneer Council and our people. This day... was never expected.</t>
 <t id="110006">For generations, we've known only silence. The stars beyond our gates were stories, warnings, even. And now Earth stands before us once more.</t>
 <t id="110007">You must understand, many among us will not welcome you. Isolation became our identity. But... survival must come first.</t>
 <t id="110008">Then let us take this first step together. Supplies will be received here at the Orbital Defence Station. I’ll coordinate the intake directly.</t>
 <t id="110009">Help us survive this winter, and perhaps, in time, we will begin to trust again.</t>
 <t id="110010">Commander, our food reserves are nearly gone. We've rationed what little we have, but children and the elderly are already suffering. If Earth can send anything, anything at all, we need it now.</t>
 <t id="110011">Thank you again for the food. But now the clinics are reporting equipment failures, and the power grid is fluctuating across the colony. Our medical and environmental systems won’t hold much longer without support.</t>
 <t id="110012">Our mainframe clusters are failing. Too many years of patchwork repairs and hand-built circuit boards. We need fresh components, microchips, computer components, anything. If we can't restore the control systems, everything else falls apart.</t>
 <t id="110013">That shipment was a lifesaver. Our systems are finally stabilizing, for the first time in years, we're not just surviving, we're rebuilding. You've given us a second chance, Commander.</t>
 <t id="110014">Commander, it’s good to see you again. I hope the quiet has been treating you well, because that’s about to change.</t>
 <t id="110015">You remember the damaged gate in this sector? For years, we’ve considered it beyond repair. The Pioneers simply didn’t have the resources or the means to restore it.</t>
 <t id="110016">After speaking with Earth’s representatives, we believe there may be a solution. The gate’s subspace alignment chamber requires a crystalline matrix, something we’ve been unable to produce since the days of the early colonists.</t>
 <t id="110017">Yes. A very specific type of Terran energy crystal used to channel subspace energy and stabilize wormhole flow. Without it, the gate’s core remains dormant.</t>
 <t id="110018">They do, though access to them is… complicated. They’re controlled materials, used only for deep-space gate research and Trans-Orbital Accelerator calibration.</t>
 <t id="110019">The Terran Envoy, Daichi Tsu, believes the United Space Command may be willing to assist if the request comes through you. You’ve proven yourself trustworthy, Commander. We’d like you to be the one to secure the crystals.</t>
 <t id="110020">Excellent. Once we have the crystals, our engineers will begin restoring the gate immediately. If this works… it will be the first time in centuries a Pioneer-built gate reactivates.</t>
 <t id="110021">Commander, we’re all set. Join me by the gate so we can start the activation sequence.</t>
 <t id="110022">All preparations are complete. It’s your moment, Commander — EVA and bring our gate back to life.</t>
 <t id="110023">Energy levels are spiking, the gate is coming online! Commander, pull back to a safe distance.</t>
 <t id="110024">It’s happening, Commander, energy readings are off the scale!</t>

 <t id="100000">Sharp eye—you caught that, huh? No, I’m not. Despite their reputation for being insular, Industritech has been expanding for some time now, recruiting members from other races. Talent matters more to them than bloodlines these days.</t>
 <t id="100001">I intend to infiltrate several Terran stations to dig up anything I can find on gate technology. Rumors suggest they guard some valuable knowledge on the subject. But to get in, I’ll need you to transport me there. You’ll handle the flying—I’ll handle the snooping.</t>
 <t id="100002">Don’t worry, I’ve got credentials that will get me through the door—at least initially. The real danger starts once I begin digging. That’s why I need you nearby. If things go south, you’ll be my way out.</t>

 <t id="100006">I’ve got another task for you, come speak with me when you’re available.</t>
 <t id="100007">We've been piecing together the data on gate technology, but we're missing a crucial component. Since we can't produce it ourselves, we're going to have to steal it.</t>
 <t id="100008">Hopefully not, but how you obtain it is up to you. We believe several ships may be carrying a special crystal. My recommendation is to acquire a Cargo Bay Hacker from the Dukes and attempt to steal it from one of those vessels. It would also help to get a Terran Police License, this will allow you to scan ships without drawing unwanted attention.</t>

 <t id="110002">Can you imagine? An entire Terran colony, cut off for centuries, just waiting to be rediscovered! This could be the beginning of a whole new chapter for both our peoples.</t>
 <t id="110003">Of course, I’m sure they’ll welcome us with open arms. After all, who wouldn’t want to reconnect with home?</t>
 <t id="110004">This can't be it. The Pioneers built entire colonies. Where is everyone?</t>
 <t id="110005">They didn’t just survive, they built something beautiful. We’re looking at a living piece of Terran history.</t>
 <t id="110006">This is Envoy Daichi Tsu of the United Space Command. We come in peace, with the full support of Earth’s leadership.</t>
 <t id="110007">We’ve searched a long time for you. We wish only to open dialogue and offer assistance where we can.</t>
 <t id="110008">Lt. Maera, your words are understood. The USC comes not to dominate, but to reconnect, and to assist where we can.</t>
 <t id="110009">Our records of the Pioneers ended with the gate collapse. Your survival is nothing short of remarkable. And now, your situation is clear.</t>
 <t id="110010">Our commanders have authorized an aid initiative. Humanitarian shipments are already being organized.</t>
 <t id="110011">Commander, the Pioneer colony is in dire need. We've authorized immediate humanitarian support. Assist Lt. Maera in coordinating the first supply drops. Earth is counting on you to make this right.</t>
 <t id="110012">Commander, you've done more here than we could have asked for. The people of Terra Nova are no longer starving, they're planning for the future. For now, stand down. We'll remain on station to continue our work. We'll call when the next step is ready.</t>

 <t id="816">Looking for a loyal gun hand—or at least a reliable one.</t>
 <t id="817">Might be something in it for you… if you’re not squeamish.</t>
 <t id="818">So, you game or not? I need someone with backbone.</t>

 <t id="850">Clock’s bleeding out, mate—get yer thrusters movin’!</t>
 <t id="851">Time’s up, whelp. You missed the mark.</t>
 <t id="852">What in the void was that!? You’ve completely lost the plot!</t>
 <t id="853">Nah, this job’s for someone who’s got real teeth.</t>
 <t id="854">You’ll need a gunboat, not that tin can you’re flyin’.</t>
 <t id="855">Need a proper freighter for this gig. Yours ain’t cuttin’ it.</t>
 <t id="856">No jumpdrive? No job. That’s the deal.</t>
 <t id="857">Transporter’s non-negotiable on this run.</t>
 <t id="858">Come back when you’ve geared up proper, greenhorn.</t>
 <t id="900">Hatch’s sealed—I’m in. Let’s get rollin’.</t>
 <t id="901">Punch it, pilot. Time’s wastin’!</t>
 <t id="902">Yer grip on that thruster’s softer than space mold! Fly, damn you!</t>
 <t id="903">Let me off this tin can before I lose me lunch!</t>
 <t id="904">Not bad, pilot. Got me here in one piece!</t>
 <t id="905">What in void’s name—ain’t no way I’m squeezin’ into that crate!</t>
 <t id="906">You expect me to ride back there and *breathe vacuum*? Get a real transport system!</t>
 <t id="907">I’m no freighter freight! You want this run, get a proper ship or we’re done.</t>
 <t id="910">Cargo's in hand. Much obliged, scallywag!</t>
 <t id="911">This stash won’t last. Get movin’ with the next load!</t>

 <t id="929">All ships, listen up! Orders incoming!</t>
 <t id="930">Pilot! You ain't done yet—here’s what you do next.</t>
 <t id="931">Stick to my thrusters, don’t fall behind!</t>
 <t id="932">Quit grinnin’ and button it up! We got trouble, inbound </t>
 <t id="933">missiles.</t>
 <t id="934">fighters.</t>
 <t id="935">bombers.</t>
 <t id="936">ships.</t>
 <t id="937">Set yer intercept, and close the gap—go, go, go!</t>
 <t id="938">Mines dead ahead! Evasive now, unless you like flyin’ in chunks!</t>
 <t id="939">Eyes up and guns hot. We’ll need cover fire real soon.</t>
 <t id="940">What are ya, brain-fried? Yer hold's stuffed! Dump some cargo or stay stuck!</t>
 <t id="941">Dock up here so I can sling you what you’re after.</t>
 <t id="942">Too many eyes out here. Get docked and we’ll hand off the goods quiet-like.</t>
 <t id="943">Now *that’s* a ship worth the trouble. Bring ‘er in and dock!</t>
 <t id="944">You draggin’ your thrusters for a reason? Get on with it!</t> 
 <t id="945">Bring it in, slow and steady. Dock up now.</t>
 <t id="946">You’re outta range, genius. Ease forward a notch!</t>
 <t id="947">Close contact! Fall back! Fall back *now*!</t>
 <t id="948">No scraps left for you at the moment. Sit tight or go cause trouble elsewhere.</t>
 <t id="949">You’ve earned your salt with us. We got somethin’ shiny with your name on it.</t>
 <t id="950">Oi, Sector pigs on the horn! They say you’ve got a hotbody aboard. Cut ‘em loose or they’ll come knockin’—guns first!</t>
 <t id="951">If yer spine grows back, come crawling back later.</t> 
 <t id="952">Say that again and I’ll teach you the hard way!</t>
 <t id="953">Relax, mate. Give it another go—you ain’t dead yet.</t>
 <t id="954">Now *that’s* what I’m talkin’ about! Nice work!</t>
 <t id="955">Hah! That’s slick flying right there!</t>
 <t id="956">Aye, you nailed it! That’s how we roll!</t>

 <t id="100001">Name’s Mira Selis. I used to be a researcher for one of the corporate labs before I saw how much more freedom, and credits, there are in pirate space.</t>
 <t id="100002">Now, I don't just give away my expertise for free. If you want my help, you're going to have to prove you're not another starched-uniform errand boy.</t>
 <t id="100003">Let’s see if you can fly like one of us. I've arranged a simple smuggling run. Nothing too fancy—just slip a few cases of *unsanctioned tech components* past some overly curious customs patrols.</t>
 <t id="100004">If you get pinched, I don’t know you. But if you pull it off clean, then maybe, just maybe, I’ll help you figure out what those wrecks of yours are hiding.</t>
 <t id="100005">Well well... you pulled it off. Smooth work, flyboy. Maybe there's hope for you Terrans after all.</t>
 <t id="100006">A deal's a deal. I've packed my research kit and said my goodbyes, such as they were. Get me to that Terran outpost in Saturn, and we’ll see what secrets your wrecks are hiding.</t>
 <t id="100007">Aye, you’ve earned my respect, pilot. I’ll throw in with you, swing by and pick me up.</t>
 <t id="100011">Unlocking these secrets is vital if we want to reconnect the lost colonies and help them rejoin the wider Terran community.</t>
 <t id="100012">Huh. If someone went through the trouble of severing a gate, they had to be desperate... or smart. Maybe both.</t>
 <t id="100013">We pirates call that “cutting the trail.” Lose the scent. Seems these pioneers were playing the same game on a galactic scale.</t>
 <t id="100014">No weapons, no guards, no warnings. Either they cleared out fast... or they never came back to finish the job.</t>

 <t id="832">You're going to take some heat on this mission.</t>
 <t id="833">You'll be done before starfall.</t>

 <t id="842">Thanks for your help with this one!</t>
 <t id="843">Great! Your work is without fault, as usual.</t>

 <t id="849">Take a look through your charts, pilot!</t>
 <t id="850">You're on the clock and it's running down fast!</t>
 <t id="851">Shoot, that's it. You're through, out of time.</t>
 <t id="852">Think that's funny!? That's coming straight out of your pay!</t>
 <t id="853">Nothing happening! I want someone with stones.</t>
 <t id="854">You need a fully-prepped combat ship for this.</t>
 <t id="855">You need a fully-prepped transporter for this.</t>
 <t id="856">You'll need a jumpdrive for this mission.</t>
 <t id="857">Without a transporter device, nothing happening.</t>
 <t id="858">Go grab yourself one!</t>
 <t id="900">(Passenger on board)Okay, I'm secure!</t>
 <t id="901">(Passenger on board)Punch it! Get me where I want to be!</t>
 <t id="902">We're losing precious time here! Get there already!</t>
 <t id="903">I'm through with this, let me off your ship.</t>
 <t id="904">We made it! Thanks for the ride!</t>
 <t id="905">There's no way I'm going to fit in your hold!</t>
 <t id="906">Do I look like Xenon? Get a cargo life support system!</t>
 <t id="907">What? You want me to fly with you in that? Get a passenger transport!</t>
 <t id="910">Your delivery is confirmed. Great work!</t>
 <t id="911">Still need more. Awaiting further shipments.</t>
 <t id="912">Your ship's a little empty. Grab some equipment.</t>
 <t id="913">Your goods are being transferred.</t>
 <t id="920">What happened here? You think this is in any way acceptable? Think again.</t>
 <t id="921">Set your intercept vector and neutralise all hostiles.</t>
 <t id="922">We need to regroup! Fall back and head for the Command Base!</t>
 <t id="923">Someone call for a little extra fire? Light 'em up, we'll put 'em out.</t>
 <t id="924">Great! We have more ships punching in through the (gate)</t>

 <t id="943">Amazing! You have the ship! Dock it at this station please!</t>
 <t id="944">Is there something you're waiting for? Get on with it!</t>
 <t id="945">Lay in an approach vector and dock your ship, pilot.</t>

 <t id="100000">Commander, I’ve reviewed your request for Crystalline Matrix. You do understand this material falls under strategic resource classification, correct?</t>
 <t id="100001">Priority or not, we have limited reserves. Every crystal is accounted for, and most are already allocated to Terran defense and research projects.</t>
 <t id="100002">I’ve read the Pioneer reports… Hard to imagine descendants of Earth surviving cut off for centuries. Still, handing over a controlled resource set is not a decision I take lightly.</t>
 <t id="100003">You sound like High Command’s idealist corps, Commander. Very well, I can authorise a shipment, restricted quantity only. Enough to power one gate core. You’ll sign and assume full responsibility.</t>
 <t id="100004">I’ll have it transferred to your command vessel. And Commander… understand, this isn’t a gift. It’s a test of trust, from the USC, and from me personally.</t>
 <t id="100005">Then I hope your mission proves worth the risk. Dismissed, Commander. And… may the stars guide you safely home.</t>

 <t id="100000">Salutations hunter. I've identified a potential new sector, but unfortunately, I lack the means to reach it. I believe you possess a device capable of locating a hyperspace access point.</t>
 <t id="100001">Fantastic. Initially, we must enhance the device by adding extra targeting parameters; otherwise, it won't effectively detect the location. Proceed to my engineering contact to obtain the upgrade, and be prepared to complete a task if necessary.</t>
 <t id="100002">I've communicated with my guild contacts, and they're coordinating the delivery of a Trans-Orbital Accelerator to facilitate access to the new sector. They'll reach out to you shortly if additional assistance is required. Thank you for your commendable efforts, pilot; this contribution will significantly enhance the guild's influence.</t>
 <t id="100003">Pilot, we've arrived. Please take me to the nearby trading station.</t>
 <t id="100004">Appreciate it, hunter. You're free to head out and locate the Hyperspeed access point now.</t>
 <t id="110000">Greetings fellow navigator, how can I assist?</t>
 <t id="120000">Ah, you must be the Terran pilot I was informed about, welcome.</t>
 <t id="120001">I’d be glad to help, but unfortunately, I’m in the middle of something at the moment.</t>
 <t id="120002">I could use your assistance. The local sectors are in urgent need of food supplies. If you can deliver the much-needed provisions, I’ll be able to join you afterward.</t>
 <t id="120003">The Xenon remnants we’ve found are dangerous. We must be cautious as we scan and investigate these wrecks.</t>
 <t id="120004">Oh, delightful! A Terran, here to unravel mysteries!</t>
 <t id="120005">You speak of old ships, forgotten designs... It tingles my curiosity like electric algae!  I would be positively bubbling to assist, but I'm afraid science must wait for sustenance.  I could use your assistance.</t>
 <t id="120006">The local sectors are in urgent need of food supplies. If you can deliver the much-needed provisions, I’ll be able to join you afterward.  Deliver the supplies, and I shall pack my equipment and swim straight into your investigation!</t>
 <t id="120007">Oooh! Gululu remembers now! The old gate harmonics sing. This one, this one is... off-key. Closed like a clam in deep waters.</t>
 <t id="120008">Not just damaged, cut off. Someone closed the loop. That means someone wanted to hide.</t>
 <t id="120009">Fascinating, yes! A gate hidden from even ancient Terran records? This indicates deliberate rerouting or suppression of its signal signature. Not natural, no no!</t>
 <t id="120010">If the Pioneer Terrans tampered with gate architecture, it suggests they understood far more about jump network geometry than previously believed. Or… perhaps someone else did?</t>
 <t id="120011">Yes yes! Althes does not follow the usual gravitic footprints of standard gate-lane structures. Something reconfigured this system, intentionally.  The Pioneers may have been more clever than we assumed. Or... something else wanted them hidden.</t>
 <t id="120012">And look, look! Residual field harmonics... still pulsing! There may be trace nav data locked in the sub-layer. We must scan it!</t>
 <t id="120013">A new ecosystem... untouched by modern interference! Ooh, the data we could collect…!</t>
 <t id="120014">Some of these facilities are still drawing power, faint but present. Automated systems, perhaps? Maintenance drones long gone feral...?</t>

 <t id="100002">Though it pains me to confess, I was once affiliated with a pirate clan. I've been striving to sever ties with them, but departing from such groups isn't a straightforward process. The clan is persistent, sending hunters to eliminate me. If you can dispatch these pursuers, it would convey a clear message to the clan to cease their pursuit, allowing me to resume my endeavors.</t>

 <t id="804">I am in need of a combat pilot.</t>
 <t id="805">I need a ship untainted by one such as you!</t>
 <t id="806">I require the delivery of various items.</t>
 <t id="807">I have no wish to die in this wretched place, my journey requires protection.</t>
 <t id="808">I must have a freight pilot</t>
 <t id="809">I seek someone skilled in the art of assassination.</t>
 <t id="810">I have a passenger, one who requires transport.</t>
 <t id="811">I need transportation, the ship must be worthy of my status.</t>

 <t id="832">Given your skills, this mission may prove to hold great difficulty.</t>
 <t id="833">Given your skills, this mission should not take long.</t>
 <t id="834">This job is far from short in duration.</t>

 <t id="848">Run, coward, run! No sector is safe, I will find you, I WILL find you!</t>
 <t id="849">Check your guidance systems.</t>
 <t id="850">You have very little time, make haste!</t>
 <t id="851">Your time has come to an end.</t>
 <t id="852">By the light, you test me! I curse your soul for this!</t>
 <t id="853">Experience in navigation is essential, you have no such experience.</t>
 <t id="854">A combat ship is essential for this.</t>
 <t id="855">You will require a ship capable of transport for this.</t>
 <t id="856">A jumpdrive is required.</t>
 <t id="857">You'll need a transporter device.</t>
 <t id="858">Get one now!</t>

 <t id="901">Let us begin our journey.</t>
 <t id="902">I have seen Maja snails move faster. Make haste.</t>

 <t id="904">I must depart, our journey has come to an end.</t>
 <t id="905">Unholy one, you must provide me with more space.</t>
 <t id="906">You will require a life support system to take passengers onboard!</t>
 <t id="907">You dare offer me passage in that? I must have a passenger transport!</t>
 <t id="910">Your delivery has been processed.</t>
 <t id="911">Deliveries are incomplete. We await completion.</t>
 <t id="912">No ship will last long without suitable equipment. Buy some.</t>
 <t id="913">Now transferring the wares.</t>
 <t id="920">There is no sense to this. What happened here pilot?</t>
 <t id="921">Engage intercept course at full thrust. Eliminate all hostile ships.</t>
 <t id="922">We would be wise to regroup and fall back to base for now.</t>
 <t id="923">Support is here! Let us burn these unholy wretches!</t>

 <t id="938">Those mines will not take kindly to contact. Show caution.</t>
 <t id="939">There must be no attack against our ship!</t>
 <t id="940">You would be wise to empty your hold, your cargo needs more space.</t>
 <t id="941">Your cargo will not be transferred until you dock at our station.</t>
 <t id="942">The data you require will remain with us until you dock.</t>
 <t id="943">Please dock the ship at the station immediately.</t>
 <t id="944">What is keeping you? Get going!</t>
 <t id="945">Your ship would do well to dock.</t>
 <t id="946">Your distance concerns us. Move closer.</t>
 <t id="947">You are far too close! Move away!</t>
 <t id="948">You would be wise to seek work elsewhere. We have nothing of interest to you.</t>
 <t id="949">Our faith in the unholy one is restored. Your loyal service will not go unrewarded.</t>
 <t id="950">Paranid Security detect illegal passenger. Unholy one will release it or die.</t>

 <t id="100000">I need someone to help construct a station here. If you can source and build a Space Jewellery M, I would be grateful.</t>
 <t id="100001">Thanks for the help pilot, this should be very useful for us.</t>
 <t id="100002">Welcome back, pilot. Since you’ve helped us before, we need your assistance once more.</t>
 <t id="100003">We've discovered a new group of sectors we want to expand into, but the gate leading there is damaged. We need to figure out how to repair it.</t>
 <t id="100004">The Terrans are known for building and repairing gates. We need you to acquire that knowledge from them—but we doubt they’ll share it willingly.</t>
 <t id="100005">Exactly. We have another agent stationed near the Terran border who has more details. Go meet with them.</t>
 <t id="110000">Assassin, how can the Guild help?</t>
 <t id="110001">Ah there you are loyal assassin.  We are looking to build a proper headquarters for the guild and we need your assistance.</t>
 <t id="110002">We have discovered an unclaimed sector we wish to utilize. We need your help to claim it for the guild. First, head to the new sector and rendezvous with your contact there, who will provide further instructions.</t>
 <t id="120000">This is Paranid sector security, stop your engine and prepare to be scanned.</t>
 <t id="120001">We've had a lot of Yaki smugglers around here recently, we need to scan everyone.</t>
 <t id="120002">Cargo shielding detected, surrender your ships.</t>
 <t id="130000">You have come to the right place. As a Paranid, my scientific knowledge is unmatched. However, my brethren are currently in need of my aid. If you can offer your support, I shall accompany you.</t>
 <t id="130001">Our convoys have been under constant attack from troublesome Yaki raiders. We need help in dealing with them.</t>
 <t id="130002">You honor the Three-Eyed, pilot. I will aid you, come and collect me.</t>
 <t id="130003">The actions of the Terran Pioneers resonate deeply within our culture. Their decision to sever the gate reflects a profound commitment to protection.</t>
 <t id="130004">We stand ready to assist you in this vital endeavor to reconnect the lost colonies.</t>
 <t id="130005">Terran High Command seeks wisdom beyond its vision? How refreshingly honest.  Your kind, ever eager to master that which they barely comprehend, now turn to those gifted with the clarity of three eyes.  Ancient gates, you say? Hmph. Many whisper of relics, but few recognize their deeper truths.  If these remnants are indeed as you describe, then they demand interpretation only the Paranid can provide, not your blinkered engineers.</t>
 <t id="130006">You seek clarity? Then gaze through eyes not burdened by ignorance.  I will accompany your investigation, not for your sake, Terran, but because truth yearns to be revealed.  Perhaps, in your blundering, you have uncovered something worthy of true study.</t>
 <t id="130007">However, there is a matter of mutual benefit. Our convoys have been under constant attack from troublesome Yaki raiders. We need help in dealing with them.  Assist us in protecting our sacred commerce, and I shall lend you my insights.</t>
 <t id="130008">Terran records are as scattered as your gate networks. Perhaps if your ancestors had three eyes, you’d have seen this coming.</t>
 <t id="130009">Still... the signal echo does carry faint traces of gate harmonics. Damaged, fragmented, yet... deliberate. I dare say, someone shut a gate on purpose.</t>
 <t id="130010">Signs of industrial-scale resource extraction. They harvested this system for something. But this is only part of the puzzle.</t>

 <t id="1018">In the far reaches of the cosmos, where lawlessness and danger often eclipsed the reach of official authorities, the Bounty Hunters Guild emerged as a beacon of order and retribution. This covert guild, was founded to fill the void left by ineffectual law enforcement agencies and to bring swift justice to the interstellar frontier.</t>

 <t id="1026">The origins of the Bounty Hunters Guild date back to a time when space colonies and trading hubs teetered on the brink of chaos. Lawlessness ran rampant, and piracy became an ever-present threat to the burgeoning spacefaring civilizations. A group of experienced and determined individuals from diverse backgrounds saw an opportunity to establish a force that could stand against the tide of criminality.\n\nUnder the leadership of an enigmatic Paranid known simply as “Starfall,” the guild adopted a code of ethics that emphasized the capture of notorious criminals, the retrieval of stolen goods, and the protection of innocent lives. They developed an extensive network of informants, sophisticated tracking technology, and a fleet of well-equipped starships, all tailored for the dangerous work of hunting bounties across the galaxy.\n\nThe guild’s membership quickly grew to encompass a broad spectrum of individuals, from cyber-enhanced ex-soldiers to skilled trackers and technologically savvy hackers. Each Hunter underwent rigorous training in combat, investigation, and diplomacy, ensuring that they were well-prepared for the complex, ever-evolving challenges of their profession.\n\nBounties offered by the Bounty Hunters Guild ranged from capturing infamous space pirates and fugitive war criminals to retrieving stolen relics and lost starships. Successful completion of contracts was rewarded not only with substantial credits but also with respect and admiration from the communities they protected.\n\nAs the Bounty Hunters Guild flourished, it became a symbol of hope and justice on the fringes of the known universe. The Hunters’ stories of daring chases, epic showdowns, and relentless pursuit became legendary tales in the galaxy, celebrated for their unwavering commitment to preserving peace among the stars.\n\nThe Bounty Hunters Guild served as a vital force against lawlessness in the cosmos, a testament to the enduring power of unity and shared purpose among those who dedicated themselves to the noble cause of upholding justice on the stellar frontier.</t>

 <t id="1156">Salutations, hunter. I've identified a potential new sector, but unfortunately, I lack the means to reach it. I believe you possess a device capable of locating a hyperspace access point.</t>
 <t id="1157">Yes I have the Low Frequency Locator</t>
 <t id="1158">Fantastic. Initially, we must enhance the device by adding extra targeting parameters; otherwise, it won't effectively detect the location. Proceed to my engineering contact to obtain the upgrade, and be prepared to complete a task if necessary.</t>
 <t id="1159">I hear you can upgrade my LFL Device</t>
 <t id="1161">Can I assist with your problems?</t>
 <t id="1163">So what can I do to help?</t>
 <t id="1165">Eliminate the pirate hunters that are chasing {actor.name@L3GB02.Contact2}</t>
 <t id="1166">Pilot, your attempt was unsuccessful. My life remains in jeopardy, and additional hunters are en route. Eliminate them all to ensure my safety.</t>
 <t id="1167">Appreciate your assistance, pilot. The immediate threat has subsided. Kindly come back to me, and I'll enhance your low-frequency locator as promised.</t>
 <t id="1168">I'm here for the upgrade.</t>
 <t id="1169">Commencing the upgrade now. Please stay docked during the process. I'll reach out to you once it's complete, it shouldn't take to long.</t>
 <t id="1170">We haven't finished the upgrade, please redock</t>
 <t id="1171">{player.name}, I'm delighted to inform you that the upgrade process has been successfully completed. Your equipment is now fully enhanced and ready for use. We appreciate your invaluable assistance throughout this endeavor. Should you have any further questions or require additional support, don't hesitate to reach out. Safe travels, and may your upgraded tools serve you well in your endeavors.</t>
 <t id="1172">{player.name}, I've received communication from my contact, and it appears your upgrade was a success. Kindly return to my location and pick me up. Ensure your ship is equipped with cargo life support for my safe transport.</t>
 <t id="1173">I'm aboard. Our destination is \033B{sector.name@L3GB02 Stage2.Sector}\033X. Upon arrival, you can disembark me at the local station. Your LFL should now detect a new hyperspace point, which it couldn't identify before due to the local nebula hindering its efficiency. The recent upgrade has bolstered its power, enabling improved functionality within the nebula.</t>
 <t id="1174">Whats our next step?</t>
 <t id="1175">I'm here as requested</t>

 <t id="1302">The ::GOV:: are fed up with the constant attacks by \033G::PILOT::\033X of the \033G::RACE::\033X on our military transports.</t>

 <t id="1304">The ::GOV:: has had enough of the \033G::RACE::\033X and their arrogant ways. It's time to teach them a lesson by taking out one of their most famous pilots, \033G::PILOT::\033X</t>
 <t id="1305">\033G::PILOT::\033X has stolen one of our ships. We pursued but ::PILOT:: activated his jump drive and managed to escape. The ::GOV:: wants this \033G::RACE::\033X dealt with as soon as possible</t>

Thirty Jazura's ago, a ::GOV:: pirate landed on this station amidst the celebrations at the birth of our little princess. Under our very noses he stole her away to be sold for means we have never yet made clear. Despite many searches, our hopes slowly faded as first the mazuras, then jazuras went by. We know now that she will never come back to us. Our hearts still hold vengeance and injustice against this pirate who must be dealt with.\n\nWe see you to be of good character and spirit, all we ask is that you have a fast ship and good weaponry.</t>
 <t id="1400">3</t>
 <t id="1401">Since we believe the target has been assisted by spies within the government we must keep our actions secret. This means that you will be considered a hostile target by the local forces once you engage the target. If you succeed you will be rewarded well.</t>
 <t id="1402">This is a highly classified mission. We cannot let the public know of this craft's existence therefore you will be treated as an enemy the by local forces. However, you will be highly rewarded if you are successful.</t>

 <t id="200001">In the vast expanse of the cosmos, where civilizations and species interconnected through trade, known simply as “The Merchants Guild,” emerged as a pivotal force in the interstellar marketplace. The guild’s origins can be traced back to a time when disparate worlds, planetary colonies, and remote outposts sought a reliable framework for interstellar commerce.</t>
 <t id="200002">The Merchants Guild was founded by a profit hungry Teladi, Wegoras Towisaris Dasinos I, who recognized the potential of unifying the fractured markets of the galaxy. Drawing upon her own experiences as a trader, Wegoras Towisaris Dasinos I rallied a diverse group of traders, economists, and diplomats to establish the guild’s foundational principles.\n\nUnder the astute leadership of Wegoras Towisaris Dasinos I, the Merchants Guild developed a comprehensive interstellar trade network that spanned star systems, planets, and asteroid belts. They implemented standardized trade agreements, established trade routes and infrastructure, and created a common currency, which facilitated commerce throughout the galaxy.\n\nThe guild attracted a multitude of members who hailed from various species and backgrounds, from shrewd negotiators to master pilots, and ingenious engineers. Each member was required to adhere to a strict code of ethics that emphasized fairness, transparency, and honesty in all trade dealings. This code earned them a reputation for integrity and trustworthiness, which was critical in the often treacherous world of interstellar commerce.\n\nThe Merchants Guild provided various services, including trade mediation, protection against piracy, and investment in promising planetary colonies. They ensured the safe transport of goods, technological innovations, and cultural exchanges, making them integral to the galactic economy. Their emblem, a celestial globe encircled by interconnected stars, became a symbol of prosperity and unity across the cosmos.\n\nOver time, the Merchants Guild extended its influence, negotiating trade agreements between powerful factions, assisting in the distribution of vital resources, and contributing to the peaceful coexistence of various species and civilizations. Their commitment to fostering economic harmony became their enduring legacy.\n\“The Merchants Guild” was celebrated not just as merchants but as peacemakers and custodians of the galaxy’s economic balance. Their story was a testament to the unifying power of commerce and the idea that, amidst the infinite expanse of the cosmos, the pursuit of mutual prosperity could serve as the foundation for unity and collaboration among the stars.</t>

 <t id="300012">The Mercenaries Guild had their origins in the aftermath of a brutal interstellar conflict that had devastated entire systems, known as the Boron Campaign. Many of the veterans who had once served their respective factions found themselves disillusioned with the relentless cycle of war. They yearned for freedom, self-determination, and the opportunity to put their combat expertise to profitable use.\n\nUnder the visionary leadership of Split General Ghorok t’Zhht, a charismatic and battle-scarred commander, the Mercenaries Guild was founded. This guild quickly gained a reputation for their unwavering loyalty to their contracts, efficient execution of missions, and an unwavering commitment to maintaining their code of honor.\n\nThe guild’s diverse membership encompassed warriors from all corners of the galaxy, each with their own unique set of skills and combat styles. From cyber-enhanced soldiers to elite snipers, and starship aces to infiltration specialists, the Mercenaries Guild offered a versatile force ready to undertake a wide range of missions, from defensive operations and combat training to clandestine espionage and planetary invasions.\n\nContracts for the Mercenaries Guild varied widely, from providing security to trade convoys and defense to beleaguered colonies to toppling oppressive regimes and eradicating dangerous criminal organizations. The guild’s reputation for delivering results made them a sought-after force in the galaxy, attracting a broad clientele of planetary governments, megacorporations, and even private individuals.\n\nGeneral Ghorok t’Zhht instilled a strong sense of honor among the mercenaries, which included a strict rule against harming civilians, protecting their clients’ interests, and upholding the guild’s legacy of reliability. The Mercenaries Guild were notorious for never backing down from a fight, even in the face of overwhelming odds, and their iconic emblem, a pair of crossed celestial swords, became a symbol of hope and strength throughout the galaxy.\n\nThe Mercenary Guild’s story was one of camaraderie, adventure, and the pursuit of independence. They stood as a powerful testament to the indomitable spirit of those who chose to forge their destiny amidst the chaos and uncertainty of the stars.</t>
 <t id="300013">General Ghorok t’Zhht \(Strong Arms\)</t>
 <t id="300014">In the turbulent and lawless depths of the galaxy, the Mercenary Guild emerged as a formidable force, forged from a coalition of battle-hardened warriors, combat specialists, and renegade soldiers who sought independence and adventure beyond the constraints of conventional military structures.</t>

 <t id="400017">In the shadowy depths of the intergalactic underworld, a clandestine organization known as the Assassins Guild arose, becoming the stuff of whispered legends and chilling tales among the stars. They were the Silent Shadows of the Stars, feared and revered for their unparalleled skills in the art of assassination.</t>

 <t id="400019">SquidKiller \(Split\)</t>
 <t id="400020">The origins of the Assassins Guild remain shrouded in mystery, their formation obscured by a tapestry of lies, disinformation, and untraceable trails. It is said that the guild was born out of a coalition of elite mercenaries, ex-military operatives, and brilliant scientists, each with their own reasons for delving into the darkest realms of contract killing.\n\nUnder the fearless leadership of a figure known only as “SquidKiller”, presumed to be a Split pirate from a long dead Split Family, the Assassins Guild meticulously honed their craft. They embraced cutting-edge technology, biologically enhanced agents, and specialized weaponry to become the most formidable assassins in the galaxy. Each member was trained to be a master of disguise, infiltration, and the art of silent takedowns.\n\nContracts for the Assassins Guild ranged from eliminating political dissidents and corporate rivals to sabotaging interstellar negotiations and erasing individuals who possessed knowledge too dangerous to be shared. With their reputation for efficiency and discretion, the Assassins Guild garnered an ever-expanding clientele that spanned across the galaxies.\n\nThe guild’s creed emphasized a strict code of ethics, forbidding the assassination of innocents and limiting their targets to those deemed a genuine threat to galactic peace or criminal justice. Despite their morally ambiguous work, the Assassins Guild maintained a sense of honor among their ranks, enforced by brutal consequences for any who strayed from their code.\n\nAs their legend grew, the Assassins Guild faced opposition from law enforcement, bounty hunters, and rival organizations who sought to bring them down. The guild’s notoriety for their impeccable ability to escape capture only added to their mystique.\n\nThe stories of the Assassins Guild became a chilling reminder that in the sprawling expanse of the cosmos, there were always shadows lurking in the corners, ready to carry out the deadliest of missions. The Silent Shadows of the Stars served as a dark undercurrent in the grand tapestry of intergalactic politics and intrigue, a guild whose power and influence left a lasting mark on the annals of the universe.</t>

 <t id="10100">$AUTHOR$, Senior Xenon Analyst, GalNet News</t>
 <t id="10200">"I don't want this to be the end of us. Not like this." These words from $PERSON1$, a worker stationed at $THISSTATION$. "My partner is working on another station, I know she's in just as much danger as I am, but that doesn't make it any better." $PERSON1$ was clearly concerned over the situation, refusing to continue work until the threat had been neutralised. </t>
 <t id="10201">Workers across $PEOPLE1$ sectors remain in peril as combat forces struggle to protect both freighters and stations from the threat of Xenon weapons technology. One worker, $PERSON1$, who looked particularly perturbed, took time out to say a few words to our reporter. "I know they're doing their best out there, and I salute them, but I don't feel safe here on $THISSTATION$, I'd rather be much farther away. I wish they'd let us leave. I'd rather take my chances out there in my ship than stuck here sitting pretty." </t>
 <t id="10202">While reporting from $THISSTATION$, we managed to get a few words from the partner of a patrol fighter pilot of the $GOVERNMENT1$. "It doesn't seem real. I mean I know he's out there, that he's fighting them off with the rest of our combat pilots. But when I look out there, I don't want to think of him not coming back to me. Why won't they just leave us alone? What do they want from us?" We chose not to continue our report with her due to the evident strain the situation was causing. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all affected by the current conflict. </t>
 <t id="10203">"I've never been this close to them. The sound they make, the way their weapons buzz. I don't like it." These words from $PERSON1$, the general manager of $THISSTATION$. Having halted production to allow for staff to be secured in areas that were away from possible impact points, the most he was able to do was stand and stare, silently praying that the sound and heat of Xenon firepower would not turn in our direction. "We all seem to be at the mercy of the $GOVERNMENT1$'s Military forces, I hope this is a battle we can win." </t>
 <t id="10300">"We did it! I can't believe we're still here to say that!" These words from $PERSON1$ rang out amongst the cheers and adulation that filled $THISSTATION$ and countless others in the sector as news spread of the destruction of numerous Xenon vessels that had previously entered the area. With debris rapidly being cleared, a feeling of relief had spread like a wave as traders rushed to return to their normal routines. </t>
 <t id="10301">As word spread of the success of the mission against the Xenon incursion, $PERSON1$, a worker stationed at $THISSTATION$ shouted across to us his clear delight that we were all still alive. "It's incredible! Did you see how they cut through those Xenon like they were bofu!? It's like we had some kind of new weapons technology or something, incredible I say!" Regardless of the manner by which the Xenon were disposed of, the feeling of relief has indeed been overwhelming. </t>
 <t id="10302">"He's coming back to me. I know he is. I just heard word that the last of the Xenon have been destroyed and that he was safe. I'm so glad to know this is all over." These words from a clearly relieved relative of one of the $GOVERNMENT1$ Patrol Forces pilots, who had engaged and held off Xenon vessels from attacking trade points until military units had been scrambled. There have been many acts of valour today, some will have gone unnoticed, but they have all counted towards a victory that will long be remembered. </t>

 <t id="3010000">Xenon Detected in $SECTOR1$!</t>
 <t id="3010100">We are currently working to confirm reports of Xenon activity in the sector of $SECTOR1$. $GOVERNMENT1$ patrols have spotted $NUMKHAAK$ in total at the time of this transmission. We ask all traders within this area to remain calm. Do not attempt to undertake journeys that may vector into Xenon spawn positions. Combat veterans are currently closing in on the Xenon positions, weapons-free and authorised to engage at will. Further updates will be made shortly. </t>
 <t id="3010101">A number of stations in $SECTOR1$ have transmitted urgent requests for assistance and protection following the appearance of Xenon vessels in their proximity. We urge all those who are in the area to remain calm. Patrols have been able to confirm the presence of $NUMKHAAK$ at the time of this transmission. Further updates will be made as and when we have more news. Military and combat units are on course to intercept and will engage shortly. </t>
 <t id="3010102">Combat awareness alerts have been issued for $SECTOR1$ following the detection of a number of Xenon vessels en route to coordinates well within the main trading matrix of that sector. Both free traders and military patrols have at this time marked a total of $NUMKHAAK$ on full thrust and vectoring for attack. All civilian craft are urged to take evasive action immediately and clear combat hotspots for military engagement. Updates on the situation will be made on further news from $GOVERNMENT1$ Patrol Units. </t>
 <t id="3020000">Victory Won Against Xenon Forces!</t>
 <t id="3020100">After a battle which ended with the loss of several combat veterans, it is now known that $KILLER$ launched a stunning attack run that resulted in the destruction of the Xenon vessel. While suffering major ship damage and plasma burns from ruptured thrust chambers, our hero still maintained course and launched a payload of weaponry that put an end to the reign of terror the Xenon thought would last forever within $SECTOR1$. $KILLER$, on behalf of the $GOVERNMENT1$, we salute you, and all your kind. You are a credit to your race. Long may your heroism live on in the memories of all those you have saved through your selfless actions.  </t>
 <t id="3020101">We have received notification that a Capital class Xenon Warship has been destroyed by $KILLER$ after an intense engagement in the heart of $SECTOR1$. While enemy units are still marked for elimination by sector forces, it is believed that the battle is being won, albeit slowly. Our prayers are with you, for all those currently in combat, or supporting those who are fighting to keep our frontiers safe, may you be homewards bound soon.  </t>
 <t id="3020102">With the conflict in $SECTOR1$ starting to abate, multiple Xenon units are confirmed to have been neutralised at this time. While $SECTOR1$ is still weapons free and will remain so as long as there are enemy vessels in the area, the main threats appear to have been eliminated. $KILLER$ is reported to have single-handedly turned the tide of the battle by eliminating a Capital-class warship.  $GOVERNMENT1$ Patrols have confirmed they will continue to engage with all Xenon vessels in conjunction with the strong military presence. We hope to bring you news of further success in good time. </t>
 <t id="3030000">Xenon Ships Moving Towards $SECTOR2$</t>
 <t id="3030100">Reports are coming in that one of the Xenon Vessels, possibly an M1 or M2, previously reported to have jumped into $SECTOR1$ is now on a trajectory that will bring it into $SECTOR2$ within the next few mizuras. No jump signatures have been detected at this time and it is believed the vessel is working on thrust vectoring only. All combat craft in $SECTOR2$ please remain on high alert. All non essential craft, please evacuate with immediate effect. </t>
 <t id="3030101">The battle with the Xenon in $SECTOR1$, while not yet over, has progressed to an even more deadly phase. It appears that several craft are now setting course for $SECTOR2$. While many of these craft are damaged, they are still to be classed as a high-level threat by all vessels in the target sector. We ask all civilian craft to evacuate immediately. Do NOT use the jumpgate connecting to $SECTOR1$. Neither $GOVERNMENT1$ Patrols or military units will be able to guarantee your safety. </t>
 <t id="3030102">Despite a large number of Xenon vessels having been destroyed, the threat posed by the swarm has not been reduced. Having engaged with $SECTOR1$ Patrols and military craft, the Xenon are now vectoring at full thrust for $SECTOR2$. Combat craft have been scrambled from trade stations, with defence forces preparing for the second phase of what may well turn out to be a very bloody battle. For the sake of our own, we hope the war that now rages on two fronts comes to a swift conclusion. </t>
